"Enjoyment means entertainment, satisfaction of one's soul and containment with the happenings in life. I would like to disagree with this statement. This is because entertainment would mean differently to different people. Entertainment depends on various factors like the person's attitude and his notion or perspective on entertainment.
   The younger generation tends to enjoy themselves by going to parties, meeting new people, making new friends and going for long drives. The way a youngster enjoys himself or herself depends on the attitude and nature of the individual. Some people might like to go to parties for entertainment while others might like to watch a movie.
   On the other hand the older people might also do the same things that youngsters do or they may engage in activities considered as dull and boring by the youngsters. I would like to take examples of two famous personalities here who despite their age never complained of boredom. Firstly, I would like to take the example of Mother Teresa who despite her old age found enjoyment in playing with children and serving the needy. Secondly, I would like to take the example of the famous painter, M.F. Hussain. M.F. Hussain is more than eighty years old but finds enjoyment in his paintings. He likes to draw and finds his entertainment in his drawings. 
   We can find people both among younsters and aged who remain depressed and do not tend to enjoy themselves. They lead the life of a loner and stay in recluse. The youngsters have a pressure to make their life which may in turn have an effect on the way they tend to enjoy themselves. But this might not be the case with the older people. They have a life, they have attained their goals and can live a peaceful life which in itself is an enjoyment.The old people also tend to enjoy themselves by talking to others of their age and about their life's experiences.
    Thus we see that the entire concept of enjoyment differs from one person to other. We can never say with surity that youngsters tend to enjoy more than the old people. Everything depends on the nature and the attitude of people. If somebody wants to enjoy age is never a deciding factor. It's the perspective and the likes and dislikes of a person which tends to decide how well the person is enjoying his life.",
"Before to start with my opinion of the topic i must to say that in this life what is the much important thing of a product? So if we want to responde about this question we can tell that the image of a product it's very important but it's only a vision fact. So I agree with the topic.

The advertisements make products seem a good image, so the people are involved to buy these. They show us the best quality of products and not the reality. An example is if you want buy a car you see that this car is the best for speed, or elegance, or horse power, or other characterists but you don't see what is the consume, if the power of this car is economicaly good. 

But the advertisments are in all our life, becouse if you watch TV shows or programs there are many break of advertisements, if you read a newspaper there are pages and pages of advertisements, when you go to work or only you go out in the streets you can see more and more advertisements. So they are a subliminar message. And the power of its is that can seem products better than really are.
     
However, the advertisements are most important for the economy because a good advertisements can make some profit for the industries. But the buyers have one thing from their side, that the product is much far from reality they can't buy it. 

In conclusion I'm in accord at the topic but i tell to all the people of the world that not are impressionate for the apperance of an advertisement but see the really quality of products, that we can change something in the world.",
"Thats a really really good subject, but acctully i have to say that i agree with specializing in one thing, Beacuse if some one did then when he well give 100% to making his catagory the best and making his job the best. Like if we had a cardiac doctor if you asked him he well tell you that he is trying to be the best and to invent a new methods to fix the heart. so, At the end of the road if he was ambesiuos he can do it . all am saying that its better to specialize in on subject.one, its better to improve that subject.two, it well be better for him not to be puzzled.and three,it well make him the best in that subject. however, i think the its good to have a broad knowledge but while foucsing on one major. like some one is an engeneering but at the same time he can creat other bussnis away from his major,like he could work at the stocks or open a store to sell any thing.but, there is some thing verey importanat. that this other work well not effect his major work beacuse in this way he will be a loser in both subjects. anyway my point is that both of them is good.but, for some people that is good for others the other one is better. and as the old sayin""defers in opinun will not destroy the case"".but i said mine and thank you for this verey good subject and thatsall i have to say.",
"I disagree with the statement saying that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject. I will illustrate my views below.

There is an English proverb which beautifully fits in the above case: ""A Jack of all is a master of none.""
In the past scientific knowledge was relatively limited as compared to now. Now many new fields have been developed and even in a single field there are many sub divisions. For e.g. Computers. Before there no sub-divisions in the field of computers but now we can broadly classify them as Hardware, software, Middle-ware, Internet & Networking, etc.
Even in these sub-divisions we can have several more options.
The point I am trying to make here is that fields are more diverse and varied then they were before. Hence it is simply not possible to excel in all of them and having only a general idea about them will not suffice.

Additionally knowledge has become more and more complex than before. Having a general idea about things is not enough to perform the tasks adequately. For e.g. A CFO (Chief Financial Officer) of a company has reasonable knowledge about Law. So does it mean that he will be as competent as a Lawyer specialising in these tasks? Alternatively a lawyer cannot do adequate justice to the job of a CFO.

Let me illustrate my point further. Would you like to live in a building which has been made by person having a ""general"" idea of construction, architecture and engineering or would prefer living in a building made by a team of experts in their respective fields. Focus on one topic inspires confidence not only in others but also in the person doing the job. 

Hence with the points above I have best tried to justify my conclusion.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them seem far better than they truly are. This tendency is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to buy. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information and misleading claims. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might showcase individuals who have achieved dramatic results, while conveniently omitting the fact that these individuals may have also undergone rigorous exercise regimes and dietary changes. This selective presentation creates a false impression of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely heavily on emotional appeals and visual imagery to evoke positive associations with the product. A car commercial might feature a sleek, luxurious car driving through scenic landscapes, implying that owning the car will bring happiness and freedom. However, the reality is that the car itself does not guarantee these feelings. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be informative and truthful, the majority tend to embellish the qualities of products to create a more appealing image. By selectively presenting information, using emotional appeals, and employing visual trickery, advertisers aim to persuade consumers to buy products that may not live up to their exaggerated promises. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"I don't support the idea that is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in a specific subject. Therefore I think that beeing professional means that a person has to acquire many theorical concepts at the beginning of his carrier, but he has to grow his specific skills in his major during the job-s life.
During my life I found many reasons that bring me on this idea.

First of all, a person who chooses his specific subject can be focused on his personal goals. Infact, when someone doesn't care about nothing in particular, he is usual to find a job just to earn money and take more time to think about his intersets. The time is very precious for personal knowledge and for the life in general. 

Second, be focused in a specific knowledge's area doesn't enhance more problems, otherwise more alternatives. I really believe that there are many aspects in every subjects and everyday we have to make your best choice. For instance, when a student is improving his skills on many matters it is more possible that he will fail in one of those, than onether guy who is learning about only one subject. Flexibility isn't a synonim of the dispersion of personal ideas. 

Personally, when I graduated two years ago I chose where I would like to work, in which sector and what will be my goals. I really appreciated the advices of my parents whose suggested me to find a general job to be able to change it in the future. Anyway, I preferred to be focused on my major. Now I am gratifyied by my decision and I will suggest the same to my friends that are still studying. 


For those reasons I discourage everyone to have broad knowledge.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters a well-rounded individual with a greater capacity for critical thinking, adaptability, and innovation.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to connect ideas across disciplines. By understanding concepts from various fields, one can draw insightful parallels and develop innovative solutions. For instance, a historian studying the rise and fall of civilizations might find valuable insights from an economist's analysis of market forces or a psychologist's understanding of human behavior. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of complex issues.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. When exposed to diverse perspectives and methodologies, individuals learn to question assumptions, analyze information objectively, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking ability is essential in navigating the complexities of the modern world, where information is readily available but often unreliable.
Finally, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability and resilience. In a rapidly changing world, individuals with specialized knowledge may find themselves limited in their career options or unable to keep pace with technological advancements. However, those with a broad understanding of various subjects are better equipped to adapt to new challenges and embrace opportunities in diverse fields.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and rewarding educational experience. It fosters critical thinking, interdisciplinary connections, and adaptability, ultimately preparing individuals for success in a complex and ever-evolving world.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. However, the statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" holds a significant degree of truth. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, many employ persuasive techniques that exaggerate its qualities or create an unrealistic expectation. 

One common tactic is the use of selective information. Advertisements often highlight only the positive aspects of a product, while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might showcase individuals with dramatic transformations, without mentioning the potential side effects or the need for consistent effort. This selective presentation creates a distorted image of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers. They may use heartwarming stories, celebrity endorsements, or aspirational imagery to evoke feelings of desire, happiness, or belonging. These emotional triggers can overshadow rational considerations and lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on superficial impressions. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous model in a romantic setting, suggesting that using the product will enhance one's attractiveness and social life. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative and helpful, it is important to be aware of their persuasive nature. Most advertisements strive to present products in the most favorable light, often employing techniques that exaggerate their benefits or create unrealistic expectations. By critically evaluating the information presented and considering the underlying motives, consumers can make more informed purchasing decisions and avoid falling prey to misleading marketing strategies.",
"The statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young individuals contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.


One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. Organizations like the Global Shapers Community, a network of young leaders, empower young people to address local challenges through innovative projects. From tackling environmental issues to promoting social justice, these initiatives showcase the dedication of young individuals to making a positive impact.


Furthermore, the prevalence of volunteerism among young people is undeniable. From volunteering at local soup kitchens to participating in environmental clean-up drives, young individuals are actively contributing their time and skills to improve their communities. This commitment is driven by a genuine desire to make a difference and contribute to the well-being of their surroundings.


While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal goals, it's crucial to recognize the vast number who are actively engaged in community service. By focusing on the positive contributions of young people, we can foster a more inclusive and appreciative view of their role in society. The statement that young people do not give enough time to their communities is a misrepresentation of the reality, as countless young individuals are actively shaping their communities for the better.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image, often exaggerating their qualities. I firmly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, employing a range of techniques to entice consumers. 

One of the most common tactics is the use of selective information. Advertisements often highlight only the positive aspects of a product, conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals achieving dramatic transformations, while failing to mention the possible side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise. This selective presentation creates an unrealistic expectation, leading consumers to believe that the product will deliver miraculous results. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ persuasive language and imagery to evoke strong emotions in viewers. By using catchy slogans, vibrant colors, and appealing visuals, they aim to create a sense of desire and urgency. For example, a car advertisement might depict a sleek, luxurious vehicle cruising along a scenic highway, suggesting that owning this car will bring freedom, excitement, and status. This emotional appeal can overshadow the practical considerations of cost, maintenance, and fuel efficiency. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may provide accurate information, the majority strive to present products in a more favorable light than they deserve. By selectively highlighting positive aspects, using persuasive language, and evoking emotions, advertisements often create an idealized image that can mislead consumers. It is crucial for individuals to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate themselves to improving their communities through various avenues. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. Organizations like the Global Shapers Community, a network of young leaders, empower young people to address local challenges. From organizing environmental clean-ups to promoting literacy programs, these initiatives demonstrate a strong commitment to community betterment.

Furthermore, the digital age has provided new platforms for young people to engage in social causes. Online platforms like Change.org allow individuals to mobilize support for various issues, while social media campaigns raise awareness and encourage action on critical matters. These digital tools empower young people to amplify their voices and contribute to positive change.
While it's important to acknowledge the challenges of balancing personal aspirations with community involvement, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which young people contribute. From traditional volunteer work to innovative digital activism, their dedication to making a difference is undeniable. Therefore, the statement that young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities is an oversimplification that overlooks the significant contributions they make.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of breadth versus depth often arises. While specialization in a specific subject offers profound expertise, I believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic disciplines is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a well-rounded education fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to critically analyze information from diverse perspectives. By studying various subjects, one develops a nuanced understanding of different methodologies, theories, and assumptions. This allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of information and a more informed decision-making process. For instance, a student with a broad knowledge of history, economics, and political science can better understand the complexities of global events and formulate more insightful opinions.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's interconnected society, individuals are constantly encountering new challenges and opportunities that require them to think creatively and apply knowledge from different fields. A person with a broad knowledge base is better equipped to navigate these challenges, as they can draw upon a wider range of tools and perspectives to find solutions. For example, a scientist with a background in humanities may be better able to communicate their research findings to a broader audience.
In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base is essential for critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, individuals can develop a more holistic perspective, become more effective problem solvers, and contribute meaningfully to society.",
"i do agree with the young people enjoy more than older people do. There are some reason why. Every year, evrey day, every hour, every moment, our world is changing and growing up to good way and bad way and  time is changeing so well. Thigns are so different between now and before. In our world have high tecnogiy and good things better than before. My grand mother and grand father telling me that you are so lucky more than me because your life is from now on and you do not worry about to eat a food. 
i think that is most luckly for me and young people. that mean is we can enjpy",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, the social pressures of fitting in and navigating complex relationships can contribute to stress and uncertainty. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find excitement in new experiences and adventures, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from the comfort of routine and the wisdom gained through years of experience. For example, a young person might find joy in traveling to a new country, while an older person might find contentment in spending time with their grandchildren. 

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that happiness is not a constant state. Both young and old individuals experience periods of joy and sorrow, and their ability to enjoy life is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond age. Ultimately, the key to finding happiness lies in embracing the present moment, appreciating the good things in life, and cultivating a positive outlook, regardless of age.",
"I mainly agree with that statement.
	I think it is obvious that advertisements make products seem better than they really are, because this is what advertisements are there fore. The aim of advertisements is to make people buy the product. To succeed best in this, advertisements have to make the product seem as good as possible. Now it is clear, that with some technical support, it is quite easy to make a product seem better than it actually is. For examle, advertisements often use very bright and shining colors, but if you compare the product with the picture, the real colors are much more 'normal'. 
	Furthermore, advertisements often use graphics, tabels or words that appear scientific to make the product seem more special, but if you know a bit about the facts displayed, you realize that they only tell very common things any other similar product also has.
	Apart from making the products seem better, advertisements also use psycological means to make people buy the product. Especially, they often try to implicitly convey a message without letting the customer really be concious about it. For example a laughing person on a photo makes people think using this product makes them happy. Or they try to make it plausible to people that they absolutely need this product because they belong to a certain groop. So advertisements often specialise to reach a distinct group of people like young parents, elderly women or middle-aged men.
	However, I think, sometimes advertisements can also help to make a new product known or to inform people about special qualities a specific product has and how it can serve them. From a customer's point of view, I think a middle way is best: One should not completely mistrust advertisements because they can really draw one's attention to something useful, but on the other hand one should neither trust them blindly. From my experience I think it is best to either try the product, so you know if you want to buy it again or not, or ask someone who has already tried it for advice.",
"Advertisements is a important part in selling products and a good advertisements will bring benefits. This statement is controversial, in the one hand the advertisements often show a good product, better than the other and the cheapest of the range. In the other hand, some brands are well known, has loyal customers and does not want to lose them by showing products better than they are. However, my personal point of view think that most advertisements make products seem much better than in the reality.

	Firstly, before going any further, I would like to give an example which comes in my mind, the washing powder on advertisements can fight against everything like ice cream on a jean or fruit juice pour on a tee shirt. Moreover, the washing powder can wash efficiently in a cold water so people can save money. According to me, this example seems exagerate to sell a product.

	Secondly, some advertisements put the best product in the advertisement but show the price of a low range product. The goal is to show that everybody can afford to have a good brand. Everybody has already seen a car advertisement, we can see the price written in big and the thing that nobody can see is written in small letters.

	Thirdly, advertising campaigns are very expensive, they use to call actors to show up the products, some professionnals are here to take the best photos they can and the best advertisement to show on television. For instance, when a child acts for a cookie, he always enjoys the product and argue next to her mother to buy this delicious cookies. The advertisement wants to reproduce the scene at home, and generally it works.

	In a nutshell, I am totally convinced that nowadays, to have market shares, advertisements are definitely fake and they show products better than the reality.",
"Do you agree or disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities? It is a great question to be offered because nowadays young generation ignore how to helping and contributing their communites more than the past. I totally agree that instead of giving enough time to helping the society,they concentrate themselves more.
First of all,because of the education from the family and the society,they teach the young generation that they should think themselves first then the other things,even the things are about the country and the world. The education tells them that no matter what happend,they should develope themselves first.According to this kind of theory, nowadays the young generation becomes more selfish then the past one.Due to this situation,I think that while we discuss that if the young people should pay more attention in their communities,the education of family and society should be discussed at the same time.
Secondly,nowadays no matter which country you belong,it is kind of tendency that there are fewer children in a family,for instance,mainland China,only one child in a family is normal.Depending on this situation,the child does not know how to get along with the other people,how to care the peer and how to contribute himself for the society.Surely,he will not focus on the need of the community and the world. The first task he thinks is how to develope himself well.Besides,nowadays parents always give too much pressure on young people's grade,and I think that's also the reason why the young generation ignore the communities and society.
To the summarize,it is kind of worse tendency that young generation does not pay attention to their communities.In my opinion,if we hope to develope more wonderful society and world which we belongs,the first task we have to do is teaching the young generation does not be selfish any more,on the contrary,they should focus on the society and world more.",
"Young people mostly experience things first. While doing new things that youngs didn't do before can enjoy them. Older peoples experienced most of the joy of the life, and to do that things again entartain less than youngs. 
Young people have more energy to do enjoyable things. Youngs are always in the way of doing new, more enjoyable things. So while capability of doing things gave youngs joy. Olders have less energy so they only use their energy to do the things that inevitable for thie life. They rest in most of their time, eat meals, sleep and do other requirements of life. They mostly cannot do what they want or what they do when they were young. The disability of doing the things that desired make olders unhappy. 
On the other hand olders think the death more than youngs. To think die in short time do the olders being pessimist about life. They think what they did in their lives most of time. The wrongs and right things. But the wrongs effect most. If he thinks of his life with full of errors he can't enjoy from the remaining life.
But olders can enjoy when they bring their childrens, and see grandsons and granddaughters running around them respect them. Most of the olders desire this scene. If they can live this scene they can enjoy more than youngs.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly across individuals. A young person might find immense joy in the thrill of new experiences, while an older person might derive satisfaction from the quiet contentment of established routines and deep relationships.
For example, a young adult might prioritize travel and adventure, while a seasoned professional might find fulfillment in their career achievements and family life.

Secondly, the challenges and pressures faced by different age groups are vastly different. Young people often grapple with the uncertainties of finding their place in the world, navigating academic and social pressures, and establishing their independence. Older individuals may face the challenges of health issues, financial concerns, and the loss of loved ones. While these challenges can be difficult, they can also lead to a deeper appreciation for life's simple pleasures and a greater sense of wisdom and perspective.
In conclusion, it is impossible to definitively state that one age group enjoys life more than another. The experience of life is multifaceted and subjective, and what brings joy to one person may not bring joy to another. Both youth and age offer unique perspectives and opportunities for fulfillment, and it is through embracing the complexities of each stage that we can truly appreciate the richness of life.",
"The ubiquitous nature of advertising in modern society has led to a widespread belief that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products. While it is true that some advertisements employ deceptive tactics to entice consumers, it is an oversimplification to claim that all advertisements present a distorted reality. This essay will argue that while some advertisements may embellish the truth, many others strive to accurately portray the benefits of products, relying on honest representations and factual information. 

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that the primary objective of advertising is to persuade consumers to purchase a product or service. To achieve this goal, advertisers often employ techniques that highlight the positive aspects of their offerings while downplaying or omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might emphasize its sleek design and advanced features while neglecting to mention its limited battery life or high price. This selective presentation of information can create an idealized image of the product that may not reflect its true capabilities. 

However, it is crucial to recognize that not all advertisements engage in such deceptive practices. Many companies prioritize honesty and transparency in their marketing efforts, providing accurate information about their products and services. For example, advertisements for pharmaceuticals often include detailed descriptions of potential side effects and risks associated with the medication. Similarly, advertisements for financial products may disclose the interest rates and fees associated with the service. These examples demonstrate that some advertisers prioritize providing consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions. 

In conclusion, while it is undeniable that some advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, it is inaccurate to generalize that all advertisements are deceptive. Many companies strive to present honest and accurate information about their offerings, empowering consumers to make informed choices. Ultimately, the effectiveness of advertising lies in its ability to resonate with consumers, and this can be achieved through both honest and persuasive communication.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and making a tangible difference. For example, the recent surge in online activism surrounding environmental issues has led to significant pressure on governments and corporations to adopt sustainable practices. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work, often focusing on areas that resonate with their interests and skills. From mentoring underprivileged children to organizing food drives and participating in environmental clean-up projects, they are actively contributing to the well-being of their communities. Many schools and universities also encourage community service, providing opportunities for students to gain valuable experience and develop a sense of civic responsibility. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact on the world around them. Their commitment to social justice, environmental sustainability, and community well-being demonstrates that they are not only concerned about their own futures but also about the future of their communities.",
"The notion that young people today are neglecting their communities is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless young individuals are actively engaged in enriching their communities through various avenues. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work. From assisting at local soup kitchens to organizing environmental clean-ups, they dedicate their time and energy to improving the lives of others. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led initiatives tackling climate change demonstrates their commitment to social responsibility. They are not just passive recipients of societal benefits; they actively strive to make a difference. 

Furthermore, young people are leveraging their technological skills to create positive change. Through social media platforms and online campaigns, they raise awareness about critical issues and mobilize support for causes they believe in. The #BlackLivesMatter movement, for example, was largely driven by young activists using digital tools to amplify their voices and spark global conversations. This digital activism showcases their ability to connect with others and drive meaningful change. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's essential to recognize their multifaceted contributions to their communities. From traditional volunteerism to innovative digital activism, they are actively engaged in making a positive impact.
It's crucial to acknowledge and celebrate their efforts rather than dismissing their contributions as insufficient.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibilities, claiming they experience more joy is a generalization that overlooks the multifaceted nature of happiness. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves with age. Young people often find pleasure in novel experiences, physical activities, and social interactions. They may prioritize excitement and adventure, finding fulfillment in exploring new horizons. However, older individuals often derive satisfaction from different sources, such as meaningful relationships, personal achievements, and a sense of purpose. They may find joy in quiet moments of reflection, appreciating the beauty of life's journey.
Secondly, the perceived lack of enjoyment in older age can be attributed to societal pressures and expectations.
Older individuals are often expected to prioritize stability and responsibility, leading to a perception that they are burdened by obligations. However, this is not necessarily indicative of a lack of enjoyment. Many older people find immense satisfaction in their roles as mentors, caregivers, and contributors to their communities. They may experience a deeper sense of fulfillment through their contributions to society.
In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain energy and freedom, it is inaccurate to claim that they enjoy life more than older people.
Enjoyment is a subjective experience that varies greatly based on individual circumstances, values, and life stages. Both young and old can find joy in their respective journeys, and it is important to recognize the unique sources of happiness that exist at each stage of life.",
"Some people would think specialize knowledge is the most important, however I prefer to choose the broad knowledge of many academic subject. There are theree reasons for this: to have many information,  to have  wide view points and to make own  new field.
     First of all, the foundation of our knowledge was decided be the quantity of the imformation. For instance, I major bussiness administration in my university. If I do not study about not only foundamental  bussiness theory but also other advertizement theory, I can not know deeply about marketing theory. Likethis,Bord knowledge is  essentioal.
     Secondly, if a persson consentrate on only the specific field,they will not be able to have wide view point. In jeneral speaking, like these kinds of people can not understand other peoples idea so they will have bias thinking way. Adding to this, these kinds people like to be minority, so they will have difficult time in their life.
     Finally, in order to make own new field, it is better to have wide knowledge. Noneless to say, new theory is made by the combain of the  fandamental knowledoge which saomeone have. If a person specialize in a specific problem, there will be limit of them. Because, new field is introduced by creative thinking based on the wide information.
     From these reasons, I think  if a person concentrate on the specific field , there are more less potentioal in their future.Truly, studying only one subject which a person really want to study is important things. Yet, when we think about this problem from long term. Clealy, having vast knowledge of many kinds of academic subject is more good for the person's future.",
"Today, we are living in an age of consumption, by consuming various products either because we vitally need them or we are conditioned to do so. As a consequence we are destined to make continuos choices about our consumption and advertisements hold an unavoidable place in the process. The way we determine our choices among, more or less equally qualified, products is connected to the way they are promoted to us to a great extent. 
	There are two ways that the advertisemets take hold of our choices, first, they associate superior qualities to a product, apart from the reality behind. As an example to such a situation, we can look at an experiment made my Coca-Cola experts testing their new formulation of coke, in late 1980s, to reveal the reason behind the steep decrease in the sales. When the experts made people try both Coca-Cola and Pepsi, without indicating their brands, even the Coca-Cola fans were not able to distinguish between the two brands and chose Pepsi, as being Coca-Cola. The main outcome of the experiment was the indication that Coca-Cola fans were overall choosing the brand based upon bombardment of advertisements, instead of a distinct difference in taste.
	The second role of advertisements to promote a product is to associate it with another aspect of life, generally with satisfaction of another need. For example, in most of the advertisements of Gilette, we see a sexy guy, half-naked, shaving himself and being adorned by women. Such advertisements give the message of: shaving with Gilette makes you attractive for women, is an important tool in increasing the sales of the product, by implicitly satisfying a subconscious desire of men.
	Overall, it becomes apperant that, in a world of choices accompanied by numerous products on shelfs, advertisements manipulate our actions. That is why big corporations invest millions of dolars in advertisement, as a sign of huge gains coming from advertisements. At this point, it is our responsibility, to make most keen choices by comparing the quality of a product with its price.",
"Advertisement should be form of product information for the customer that could give a basis to compare one product with another one. Therefore it should consist all of the features the product consists. So all positive aspects of a good will be displayed  in the ads and the negative ones will beleft out. Cigarettes for example were always glorified as a emormous gain in lifestyle and persolal selfdetermination, but the risks of getting cancer and other illnesses were never mentioned.
The means that are used in advertisements, strive to deconnect the customers buying decission from the real technical features of products and change the rational decission into an emotional. Why do we never see a blank white sheet with only the product information? We won't get emotional. Therefore there is always a message and an image which is bought with the product itself. In tv spots show often stories that  have nothing to do with the good it is advertising, but it should get the client into a positive mood and influence the decission.
Flight and hotel advertisements often show woderful habitations and beaches that create the illusion of a perfect time in vaccations, but will not state the problems there might be with enviroment around the accomodation or the problems of the people who life there. So you",
"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.There are many reasons that justify this fact.Most young people are robust and full of energy and this gives them an advantage over old people.Enjoying life means that one can be able to do all that he or she feels like doing at any time without any restrictions for example taking part in a sporting activity, travelling,spending time with friends.Most of these activities require one to be physically fit.
Young people do not have the same responsibilities as old people do so this will give them more chances of enjoying life for example old people have to be careful how they spend their money because they have a number of things to pay for; electricity bills, morgage, their children`s education ... but young people who still live with their parents have no bills to pay so whatever money they earn is directed in paying for fun trips, fancy mobile phones and the like.
Another factor that justifies the above statement is that young people are more outgoing than old people do.For example young people are very willing to take part in new adventures that old people wont be very much at ease to do for example skating or parachute jumping or even motorbike racing.Olp people will consider such activities as dangerous whereas young people will see these activities as a big thrill.
Companies that produce musical gadgets like walkmans, Compact disc players, MP3s consider the young people as their biggest customers so they model these gadgets in a way that only young people can use them easily and thus such technonological advancements dont favour old people making young people enjoy life more than old people.
Lastly, young people enjoy life more than old people when it comes to health issues.Young people are very resistant to abrupt changes in weather and their immune sysytem is stronger than that of old people.For example young people can comfortably play in the cold without having any problems but old people cant.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse and impactful contributions of this generation. While it's true that some young people may prioritize their personal pursuits, countless others are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating a strong commitment to making a difference. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led organizations and initiatives. From environmental activism groups to social justice movements, young people are using their passion and energy to address pressing societal issues. The recent surge in climate change awareness, driven by young activists like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their dedication to creating a better future. 

Furthermore, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work. They dedicate their time to local charities, soup kitchens, and animal shelters, providing essential support to those in need. Whether it's tutoring underprivileged children, organizing food drives, or cleaning up parks, their contributions are invaluable to their communities. 

It's important to recognize that the definition of community involvement can be broad. Young people are also contributing to their communities through their creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit. They are launching businesses that create jobs, developing technological solutions to real-world problems, and fostering a sense of belonging through art, music, and cultural events. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they are actively contributing to their communities. Their dedication, passion, and innovative spirit are shaping a brighter future for all.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, like exploring new experiences or pursuing romantic relationships, may hold little appeal to an older individual who values stability and meaningful connections.
For example, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive more pleasure from tending to their garden or spending time with their grandchildren.

Secondly, the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood can bring a different kind of fulfillment.
Older people often find satisfaction in their careers, their families, and their contributions to society.
They may have a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them, leading to a more nuanced and mature appreciation for life.
For instance, a seasoned professional might find immense joy in mentoring younger colleagues and sharing their expertise, a feeling that a young person may not fully grasp.
In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain carefree spirit, it is unfair to assume they inherently enjoy life more than older people.
Enjoyment is a subjective experience that evolves throughout life, shaped by individual circumstances, values, and perspectives.
Both young and old can find joy in their respective stages of life, and it is through embracing the unique experiences and challenges of each stage that we truly appreciate the richness and complexity of human existence.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial, fostering adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's rapidly evolving world, careers and industries are constantly shifting. Having a diverse understanding of various subjects allows individuals to readily transition between fields, explore new opportunities, and remain relevant in a dynamic job market. For instance, a student with a broad background in humanities and sciences might find themselves well-suited for careers in data analysis, policy research, or even entrepreneurship, as they possess the analytical skills, communication abilities, and interdisciplinary perspective necessary to succeed in these fields. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By exposing oneself to different perspectives and disciplines, one develops the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify patterns, and draw connections between seemingly disparate concepts. This holistic approach to learning allows individuals to approach problems with a more nuanced understanding and develop creative solutions. For example, a historian studying the French Revolution might draw parallels to contemporary political movements, gaining a deeper understanding of the complexities of social change and the role of individual agency. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches one's understanding of the world and fosters a sense of interconnectedness. By exploring different cultures, historical periods, and scientific discoveries, individuals gain a broader perspective on human history, societal structures, and the natural world. This holistic understanding allows for a more informed and empathetic approach to global issues, promoting tolerance and fostering a sense of responsibility towards the well-being of humanity and the planet. 

In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world, equipping individuals with the skills and perspectives necessary to navigate the complexities of the 21st century.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local food drives and environmental cleanups to advocating for social justice causes, young people are actively addressing pressing issues. The recent surge in youth activism, particularly in areas like climate change and racial equality, demonstrates their commitment to creating a better future. 

Furthermore, many young people contribute to their communities through volunteer work. They dedicate their time to organizations like soup kitchens, animal shelters, and hospitals, providing essential support to those in need.

"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, both young and old individuals can find fulfillment and happiness in different stages of life. 

Firstly, young people often face a unique set of pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming, leaving little room for carefree exploration. Moreover, the constant pressure to succeed and conform to societal expectations can create a sense of stress and dissatisfaction. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a greater sense of stability and security, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves over time. What brings joy to a young person may not hold the same appeal to an older individual. For example, a teenager might find immense pleasure in attending a concert or going on a spontaneous adventure, while an older person might derive more satisfaction from spending time with family, pursuing hobbies, or simply enjoying the peace and quiet of their home. 

Finally, it is important to recognize that happiness is not solely determined by age. Individuals of all ages can experience moments of joy, sorrow, and everything in between. The key to finding fulfillment lies in embracing the present moment, appreciating the good things in life, and cultivating meaningful relationships. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with a certain level of carefree enjoyment, it is not a guarantee of greater happiness. Both young and old individuals can find fulfillment and satisfaction in different ways, and the pursuit of enjoyment is a lifelong journey that transcends age.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of goods and services, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits of products, creating an idealized image that often fails to match reality. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight loss supplement might showcase individuals achieving dramatic results, but fail to mention the possible side effects or the need for lifestyle changes. This selective presentation creates a misleading impression of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely heavily on emotional appeals and persuasive language to manipulate consumers' desires. By associating products with positive emotions, such as happiness, success, or love, advertisers create a sense of need or longing that can override rational decision-making. For example, a perfume ad might depict a glamorous woman surrounded by admirers, implying that using the fragrance will lead to similar experiences. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to purchase products that do not meet their actual needs. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may provide accurate information, the majority tend to present an overly optimistic and often misleading picture of products. By selectively highlighting positive aspects, employing emotional appeals, and using persuasive language, advertisers create an idealized image that rarely reflects the true nature of the goods or services being promoted. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",

"I agree with the statement. 
Most of today's youth does not care about the things that are happening around them. There are lot reasons as to why young people do not spend enough time helping their communities. 
One of the most common reply one might get when asked about the reason for not helping their community is ""I don't have time for that"". In most of the cases, the actual reason is that they don't want to . For example, when I was the NSS (National Service Scheme) co-ordinator 2 years ago, We( the co-ordinators) decided to promote the local jute industry by selling jute bags in our cultural festival ""Saarang"". But unfortuantely the so called volunteers were reluctant to sell them and the reason they gave is that they can't waste time by selling bags that no one purchases.

Another popular reply to the questions is ""What do I get out of it?"".  These days young are brought up in a competitve world and every one thinks about oneself. ""If community service doesn't benefit me, why should I care?"" is the kind of attitute developed by today's youth.
For example, the Govenment of India recently passed a bill on including resevation of seats in national level institutes to OBC's (other backward classes). But from statistics their number is very minute compared to the number of general catagory students. So some of us decided to write a petition to the President of India to reconsider the bill. So we went on collecting signatures for the petition. Some of the students reply was ""I am already selected and I am going to pass this year. WHhs",
"I agree with the statement. I am now 18 years old. The ward of young people in the statement probablly meams those who are the age of 16 to 20 like me. At least for 1 year, I have not done any activity to help my local community. As for my friends, the situation is similar to mone.
   There is one big reason why we do not give enough time to helping our communities. It is entrance examinations for collage. In Japan, there is a hard competition to entre collage or university. Therefore, students of those ages have to study. There is not enough time to spend helping their communities.

"The way of doing academic researches is always developing and dividing into new branches throughout many years. As scientific and technologic innovation develops very fast, things to be researched are getting more complex and hard. Due to this, academic subjects are increasing and their context are complicated. In my opinion, specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reasons.

First of all, by specializing in one academic topic you have the opportunity to discover new things in science. When you are interested in a specified topic deeply, it is possible to consider the details carefully. For instance, human genome project is divided into several groups and every scientific group researches a detailed part of the project. By doing this, they can rapidly get results and combine them.

Secondly, working with specific subjects gives you the chance of developing new scientific groups and working in coordination. Research groups have the opportunity to study properly and organized. If one scientist have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, he can not afford to concern with all problems and fails.

Consequently, specializing in one subject for academic researches is important to the development of science and technological innovation. As we share the problems, we will be succesful quickly.",
"LIFE IS FOR YOUNGERS
When it comes to a question like who enjoys the life most, then the answer seems to be obvious.Of course; the young  people enjoy the life more than older people in terms of several reasons.
First; I can say that young people have more free time than old people.Therefore ; this means that they have more time to spent on their hobbies and favorite sports. They have a chance to do whenever they want to do such as leisure activities. For example; young people dont have to take  care children , clean  home and cook for  dinner. However; older people have to spend some time on all of these.
Second; having a joyful time in life is more related to the age.Young people have more energy than older people.They  are more energetic and physically active as compared to the older people.This enables young people to get more enjoy from life.They can go to mountains for climbing , go for skiing and go for diving. However; older people  may not  do all these activities since they can not able to find enough energy to do.Therefore; this make them not to get much joy from life. 
Finally ; it is more related to the psychology of people.Since young people have much more curiosity than older people ; they have an eager to discover new things.Young people try to get as much info as they can get from their environmet. Therefore; they have  much more tendency to enjoy the life most. In contrast; older people would not be in a mood that  they look for something new.Since they get much experience from life, they  may never find enough interest to  already discovered issues.All the above mentioned reasons indicate that life is something like for young people",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a topic of much debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in the long run. This is because it fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In a world where industries are constantly evolving and new technologies emerge at an unprecedented pace, having a diverse range of knowledge allows individuals to seamlessly transition between fields. For example, someone with a background in both history and computer science might be well-suited to work in digital humanities, a field that combines historical research with computational methods. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base encourages critical thinking. By exposing oneself to different perspectives and disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles and form well-rounded opinions. This is crucial in a world saturated with information, where the ability to discern fact from fiction is paramount. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters a more holistic understanding of the world. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of various disciplines and the complexities of global issues. This allows them to approach problems with a more comprehensive perspective, leading to more effective solutions.

"I do not completely agree with this statement, because young people usually do not realize what they have and how short and quickly the youth is. Young people are continually expecting something of extarordinary happens to make them happier, but without knowing nor themselves what this extraordinary means. Have you ever red The Colombre by Dino Buzzati? It is a nice metaphor of young people searchign a chemere during his youth, which never is found, so that  they can not taste the flavour of happyness during his flowerishing age.
Moreover, young people spend often their time doing nothing.  I see these guys standing outiside bars, smoking, drinking, of course smiling, but without a serious purpose and so risking of getting bored. In other words, they waste their time. On the contrary older people, who have less life time ahead them, do not waste time, they appreciate all what they have. They do not wait for something special happens, they do not get angry for the boyfriend or girlfriend. Older people appreciate the time passed and most of time are satisfied of what they have done during their life. They feel joy for the fact of having had children, who at their turn have had other children. Older people, despite the young, have had in the most of cases a brillant job, or just a job, which has let them create a family, buy a house, go on holidays. They are fullfilled of their reached objects. As far as young people concerns, this is not always true. Although  young people have more life time ahead, it does not mean fewer worries. Let us think of young people now: the problem of job, the problem of durable job, the worry of buying a their own house without a job! ... Concludind, enjoying life does not concern on what we are doing, but it relies on our expectations and what we managed to do before.",
"In every part of our life to have more knowlage about life is important for all of us. Especially if this knowlage is about acedemic subjects it will be more interesting for students who trying to maintained themselves. For some people it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject which I do not agree. I think it is better for someone or a student to have full of right knowledge about one suject.
   First of all its known that if someone have not right information about one subject how can he or she will know about other subjects. For example, if a person in a family dinner wants to talk about politics and starts to talk but he can not finish his sentences or can not answer the questions that his family members becouse the information that he have in his mind can not let him to express himself well. On the other hand if he had known well about politics and tell and answered th equestions about this subject it will be more affective for himself, I think it is not so much important for him to not know about international relationships which can be talked in the table. He can say he did not know about this subject and wants to know about it now  which will be better answer for that conversation.
   Secondly, in today's world to have full of academic knowledge about one subject is very important. All the parents want their children have an one job which they can take care themselves. This will be possible only if that person educate in a university. In these years no one gives a job to someone who do not finish university.
For example, when someone apply for a job no one asks for that person what kind of things do you know about different subject. They just want to no if you your aducated in university and capabile for that job.
   To sum up, I think to know about one specific academic subject 's more important than any think. Everyone have to consantrate on their only subject to be more successfull then anyone.",

                   Finally i agree that the above mention examples are shows that my oppenian on our comment.",
"It is really good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, but specializing is something that is probably more useful once a person starts working. This doesn't mean that a wide knowledge of many academic subjects isn't an advantage for those who have it.
  When a person ends his high school or university studies, he finds out that employers of many companies looks for people with specific abilities. For istance it is not very common for a person who graduated in geography to work for an investiment bank because he probably doesn't know enough about the financial markets and doesn't have as many quantitative tools as a mathematician or as a person who graduated in economics. Of course no economic graduates will easily find a job as a geography resercher. In these specific cases, which are certainly not the only, it is probably better to be specialized in a single subject.
  However, it is not very hard to understand that, between those who specialized in just one specific subject, not everyone will be able to have a succesful career. When a company choses a person to advance in his position, it doesn't look only at working abilities ( which are supposed to be pretty good for everyone), but it also looks for leadership abilities. I think that a person that has broad knowledge of many academic subjects will be most likely to have this characteristic: thanks to the many things he knows, he can speak with many different people from the many different areas of the company which he works for. This comunication ability will make it easier for him to be a leader inside the company.
  In conclusion, I don't really agrre to the topic statement because I wouldn't be able to chose between broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specialized knowledge: I would spend more time studying, so that I could have both.",
"People all over the world often discuss, wheather young peoole spend enough time helping the communities. I think that lots of young people are concernd about community and also hlep them a lot.

First of all I think this already starts in school. In every class the pupils elect one of them to be a speaker for the hole class. You have also pupils doing that for the complete school. So they learn early about being reposable for class mates and training their social skills, which is very useful for being a person who helps others and so the communities. 
But I also think that you can help community if you get yourself a good education. Because you might help better, if you have a huge knowlege in managing thinks or organisation. So I a high education standard is a big help for comunity, if the people have better jobs they will be more likely to hlep than an unemployed person who thinks that it is the communities fault that he has no job.
Moreover ther are lots of young people envolved in different organisations. They help in sport clubs for example, by organize trainig sessions or they help planning activities for the members like campings or visiting pools or cities. So they help to avoid that smaller children spend to much time by their own.
Morover I think young people also help community by doing their civil work. After finishing school the male persons will be able to do social work instead of going to the army. So lots of jobs could not be paid to be done by professional trained employers so this people help that this work is done. Lots of young people also participate in organisations as first aid or the free fireworks. So they help in their free time rescueing other people, which I think is very veluable to communities.

All in all I think there are lots of young people who care about and help communitiy, but there are also some who do not care, which is often see by more people so that they think all young people are that way.",
"The time dedicated by young people to their communities is of a great importance. It shows the interest of the younger generation for their families and culture background. I believe the young people do not spend enough time to helping their communties. They certainly have good reasons but the reward of helping is priceless.

Why do young people do not spend enough time to helping their communities? I see two main reaons: professional life and new communication technics.
Our parents used to spend most of their careeer in one or maximum two companies, in only one country. Nowadays, professional life is more suprising. One can change position very quickly, depending on opportunities. Positions are not fixed and young generation has less links with the employeer than older generation had. The firm root is not a major concern for young generation.

Communication and travel improvements allow people to move from one country to another one quicker than ever. Life is not be lived only in your home country. Internet gives you the opportunity to instantly travel via your computer. Your community is the world, your friends are all over the world. Young people will have more difficulty to follow and support their community as the community root is more difficult to identify.

But young people will have to settle themselves down one day. where will be their community at that time? Where will be their home land?
This question will be very hard to answer unless you took a great care of your roots and specifically of your community. That is the reason why I believe that giving some time to helping our community is priceless in regards of the rewards it will then bring us. Community will be what stays from an active professional life. Community will be your home. You have to take good care of your home for the time you will either need it or be back in it.",
"I think that in today's world even if a product is of excellent quality and is very useful, it still needs to be advertised in order to reach its sales potential. Having said this I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are couple of main points I want to state here in support of my conclusion.

First, there is no way for the consumers to validate the claims being made about a product in advertisement. The only way to figure out if the claims are right is by actually using the product or talking to others who have used the product. The advertiser of the products exploit the dificulty faced by consumers in validation the product related claims, by making claims which have no suppoting evidence.
The best example of this is the claims made by many of the weight reduction pills on the market. The advertisements claim that the pills will reduce weight by 50 to 100 ponds in couple of weeks.


Second point is the fact that the advertisers use well know celebrities to advertise and market bad quality products. Just because a is acting in an advertisement for a product does not mean the product is good. Most of us know this fact. But association of the celebrity with the product does seem to influence peoples buying decisions. This tells us that even though the product is not of the best quality, the advertisement made it seem good just because it has a celebrity cast. For example in India the superstar actor Amitabh Bachhan acts in so many advertisements for products which are bad in quality, but just because he is part of the advertisements the products are baught by many people.",
"It is undeniable that advertising plays a crucial role in our consumerist society. However, the question of whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is a complex one. While there are certainly instances of exaggerated claims and deceptive tactics, it is inaccurate to generalize that all advertisements are inherently misleading. 

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the inherent nature of advertising. Its primary objective is to persuade consumers to purchase a product or service. To achieve this, advertisers often employ techniques that highlight the positive aspects of their offerings while downplaying or omitting any potential drawbacks. This is not necessarily deceptive, but rather a strategic approach to presenting information in a favorable light. For example, a car advertisement might focus on the vehicle's sleek design, powerful engine, and advanced safety features, while neglecting to mention its fuel efficiency or potential maintenance issues. 

However, it is also true that some advertisements engage in outright deception. They may use misleading imagery, false testimonials, or exaggerated claims to create an unrealistic impression of the product. For instance, a weight loss product might feature before-and-after photos that have been heavily edited or rely on testimonials from individuals who have not actually used the product. Such practices are unethical and can mislead consumers into making uninformed decisions. 

In conclusion, while it is true that some advertisements employ deceptive tactics, it is inaccurate to claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertising is a complex and multifaceted industry, and its effectiveness often relies on a balance between persuasion and truthfulness. Consumers must be discerning and critical when evaluating advertisements, recognizing that they are designed to sell a product, not necessarily to provide an objective assessment of its qualities.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Online campaigns for social causes, crowdfunding platforms for local projects, and virtual volunteering opportunities have become increasingly popular, allowing young people to contribute their time and skills from anywhere in the world. For instance, the recent surge in online petitions and fundraising efforts for environmental causes demonstrates the power of young people to mobilize and advocate for change. 

Secondly, young people are often at the forefront of addressing contemporary social issues. From climate change activism to mental health awareness, they are actively involved in raising awareness, organizing protests, and advocating for policy changes. The global youth climate strikes, led by Greta Thunberg, are a prime example of young people taking a stand and demanding action from their governments. 

Finally, traditional forms of community service remain prevalent among young people. Volunteering at local soup kitchens, participating in community clean-up drives, and mentoring underprivileged children are just a few examples of their dedication to improving the lives of others. Many schools and universities also encourage and facilitate community service projects, fostering a sense of civic responsibility among students. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteering, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact on the world around them. Their commitment to social justice and community betterment is a testament to their generation's desire to create a better future for all.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic and often inaccurate generalization. While youth may possess a certain carefree spirit and a sense of boundless possibilities, it is unfair to assume that older individuals have lost their capacity for joy and fulfillment. Both stages of life offer unique experiences and opportunities for happiness, and the key to enjoying life lies in embracing the present moment and finding meaning in one's journey.
Young people often experience life with a heightened sense of novelty and excitement. They are exploring new experiences, building relationships, and pursuing their dreams with an unbridled enthusiasm. This can certainly lead to a feeling of exhilaration and a sense of living life to the fullest. For example, a young person embarking on their first backpacking trip across Europe might feel an overwhelming sense of adventure and joy.
However, older individuals have the benefit of accumulated wisdom, experience, and a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. They have weathered life's storms and learned valuable lessons along the way. This can lead to a sense of contentment, gratitude, and a profound appreciation for the simple things in life. For instance, an older person who has raised a family and witnessed their children's successes might find immense joy in spending time with their grandchildren and sharing their life stories.
Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not solely determined by age but by one's perspective and ability to find meaning and purpose in their experiences. Both young and old have the potential to live fulfilling lives, and it is important to recognize the unique joys and challenges that each stage of life presents. While youth may be characterized by a sense of adventure and exploration, older individuals possess a wealth of wisdom and experience that can lead to a deep sense of contentment and fulfillment.",
"The world of advertising is a vibrant tapestry woven with promises of happiness, convenience, and perfection. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image, often exaggerating the benefits and downplaying the drawbacks. This tendency to make products seem much better than they really are is a pervasive practice, driven by the desire to entice consumers and boost sales. 

One striking example of this phenomenon is the advertising of beauty products. Cosmetics commercials often feature models with flawless skin and radiant smiles, using heavy makeup and advanced editing techniques to achieve an unattainable standard of beauty. This idealized image can lead consumers to believe that the product will deliver similar results, when in reality, it may only offer minor improvements. The same principle applies to weight loss products, where before-and-after photos showcase dramatic transformations that are rarely achievable without significant lifestyle changes. 

Furthermore, advertisements often employ persuasive language and emotional appeals to create a sense of urgency or desirability. Phrases like ""limited-time offer"" or ""exclusive deal"" can trigger a fear of missing out, prompting consumers to make impulsive purchases without fully considering the product's value. Similarly, advertisements for luxury cars or designer clothing often evoke feelings of status and exclusivity, suggesting that owning these products will elevate one's social standing. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may offer truthful representations of products, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image that often misrepresents reality. By employing persuasive language, emotional appeals, and carefully curated visuals, advertisers aim to make products seem much better than they really are, ultimately influencing consumer decisions and driving sales. While this practice may be effective in the short term, it can ultimately lead to disappointment and a sense of disillusionment for consumers who are misled by exaggerated claims.",
"It is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I do agree with this statement. To make commurcial is one of the most investment for concerns. They have to show their product from the best side for selling it easily. You can do that with making advertisements. It is depend on the quality how you make it. You have to reach the style of the community. It has to be an eyecatcher when you looking at it so that you can say 
''I want to buy that!""
For example, I make an advertisement for a drink. First of all I have to think about it how could I make it so, that the people would buy it immediatly. One criteria could be the size of the advertisement. Another one could be the color. The style and the location is also important. It has to speak on the community. So then when I am done with the advertisement and it really looks tasty, actually no one really know the taste in it. So it could be very sweet or to sour or so on. Nobody knows the taste before they try it. So it is a kick for the people to buy the product and to taste it because on the advertisement it seems good and it makes you to buy it. That is actually the danger on advertisements. Of course this example does not show a big danger but what about a holiday advertisement? Advertisements make everything that the trip sounds perfektly and the price is also okay so people book the trip and when you go there you see the realities about the hotel or the location or what ever, which is not true with the advertisement. That could be a danger.
Anyway without advertisements the economy would be getting down and no one could sell their product anymore. 
Conclusion: Advertisements should not make products seem much better than they really are.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly between individuals. A young person might find immense joy in the thrill of new experiences, while an older person might derive satisfaction from the quiet contentment of established relationships and accomplishments.
For example, a young adult might prioritize travel and adventure, while a seasoned professional might find fulfillment in mentoring younger colleagues and contributing to their success.

Secondly, the challenges and pressures faced by different age groups are vastly different. Young people often grapple with the anxieties of identity formation, academic pressures, and financial instability. Older individuals, on the other hand, may face health concerns, career transitions, and the loss of loved ones. While these challenges can be difficult, they also offer opportunities for growth and resilience, which can contribute to a sense of fulfillment and purpose.

In conclusion, it is impossible to definitively state that young people enjoy life more than older people. Both age groups experience unique joys and challenges, and the concept of enjoyment is subjective and multifaceted.
Rather than comparing the experiences of different age groups, it is more meaningful to acknowledge the richness and complexity of life at every stage.",
"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are. Most advertisements use emotional figures, present the product in a way that is very appealing to the consumer or attacks the competitors by claiming that their product offers more quality per unit price. These are the tools that advertising companies choose for products generally in order to convince the target consumers to buy; however they can be misleading and consumers can be disappointed after their initial experince.
First of all, using the emotional figures in the advertisements  is a method used very much recently. We can see speaking cows playinf football in a milk advertisement or several cartoon figures that are the favourite ones for children. This method especially influences the kids very much and they insist on buying that product. However, the advertisment does not promise a quality for a repeated buying,
Additionally, intoducing a product in a very appealing way can be an  exaggreation. For instance, advertisement may say a chocolate is very tasteful that you can never want to share it with a friend, but it may be that it does not taste good.
Lastly, some advertisments attact competitors rather than just claming on their products and present a comparative advantages like lower price per quality, highest effectiveness, having the most beneficial  fuctions. Nevethelesss, this method also can be very misleading. For example, a car can be cheaper than the other cars with the same quality and functions, nonetheless it can have lower sustainability or less terms on guarantee. Being cheaper does not mean you will be satisfied with its quality.
In conclusion, the methods used in the advertisements can bve very misleading can cause use make wrong decisions about the things you need and you want to purchase. Sometimes, less appealing and aggressive and dull advertisments of some products can offer a much more quality or compensation for the needs and preferences.",
"People have saveral things for getting in knowledge.There is many training subjects that people have broad knowledge in one specific subject or in many academic subjects.
	I don't agree with both of it.I think people should have knowledge in one specific subject and also many academic subject.Because there is many problem in the world and much of them can't solve by knowing one subject.It requires many knowledges about different subject.For example, in engineering problems you have to know mathematics, phsics and also chemistry to solve it.
	I think a person also must be good at one subject and  he knows everything in this subject.This gives a person self convidence For example i'm an engineer and i know many thins about steel, if any body asks me some questions about it, i enjoy to tell him what he asked and i enjoy read something about it that can be in inthernet or in newspaper.
	And other reason for having more academic subjects is that makes people open minded.For example, if a writer knows something about history, he can write better. Knowing  events in the past gives him new opinion about what will happen about people.
	Having broad knowledge in one spesific subject helps people to find a job.I think if you are really really well in one subject people need your opinion and your work. Because companies hires 2 or 3 person for a subject but if you demostare them you're best in it, company prefers to hire only one.
	I think that only having knowledge of many subject can't be good for us and also having knowledge in one spesific subject can't helps us at all.People need both of it for being awerage than others.",
"According to me the advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are. The sole purpose of advertisements are to promote the sale of  a product .
In todays competetive society , the advetisers would do anything to attract our attention. They put famous celebrities in their adds and  pay millions of dollars to the T.V . stations to broadcast their adds.
Almost all adds are different and inovative,however they all have one thing in common - they all highlight only the good points about their product. They never inform the consumer what their product lacks .
Often, a person finds a difference of day and night between a product seen in the advertisement and the actual product. The companies usually ameliorate the appearence of the product when they advertise it , through computer graphics.They make it more appealing than it really is. 
Once I saw an advertisement of an acne face wash. The results of the product seemed amazing. The interviews of the users were shown in advertisement .They were all happy with the product and asked everyone to used the product. Intimidated by the add,I ordered the product . The product seemed completely inaffective and useless. I was dissapointed and from that time on  I made a resolution of never using a product without personal research.
Hence, we should not fall prey to the tempting advertisments which the companies show us, since they are far from reality",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods and services, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them seem far superior to their actual performance. This exaggeration is achieved through a variety of techniques, including selective information, emotional appeals, and misleading visuals.
One common tactic employed by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often highlight the most appealing features of a product while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. For instance, a car advertisement might emphasize its sleek design and powerful engine, but fail to mention its poor fuel efficiency or unreliable safety features. This selective approach creates a distorted image of the product, leading consumers to form unrealistic expectations.
Furthermore, advertisements frequently appeal to emotions rather than logic. They use catchy jingles, heartwarming stories, and celebrity endorsements to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or desire. By tapping into these emotions, advertisers can persuade consumers to purchase products that they may not actually need or want. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a beautiful woman surrounded by admirers, suggesting that wearing the perfume will make the consumer equally attractive and desirable.
Finally, misleading visuals are often used to enhance the appeal of products. Advertisers employ sophisticated photography, editing, and special effects to create images that are far removed from reality. A fast-food advertisement might showcase a burger that looks incredibly juicy and flavorful, but the actual product may be dry and bland. These misleading visuals create false expectations that are inevitably disappointed when consumers actually experience the product.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may provide accurate information, the vast majority employ various techniques to make products seem much better than they really are. By selectively presenting information, appealing to emotions, and using misleading visuals, advertisers create a distorted perception of products, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based on unrealistic expectations. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making any purchasing decisions.",
"It is often asked, wheter students should get a wide range of knowledge during university or just specialize on one topic.

In my eyes, the specialist is much more appropriate than a generalist.
In opposite to a generalist, who can do nearly anything, but can not do something really good, a specialist is able to, as the name tells, specialiye on one concrete thing. Therefore, he has a good, deep and great knowledge about this topic. 
Like in school, you learn a lot of stuff, you never need again in our life, because you are not interested in this things. also, you are only good in lectures you are interested in, students are less motivated in this class. This is why they wont get good marks or points in this topics, and therefor are more unmotivated.
But if you need some knowledge from other academic fields. Like business knowledge for a physican who starts his own company, you have the opportunity to get this knowledge ""learning-by-doing"" or in an autodidactic way.
Also, if you only provide general knowledge, some students were not able to start at university, because they are not interested in such a wide range. They maybe visit private universities which support this special things.
The most important thing is, that you will need a very specialised knowledge, to invent and progress things. so, only a general knowledge is not enough for research and development. this could lead society into a world without or with only few progress.
For example, if you know, how the engine in your car works exactly, doesnt mean that you are able to build one up by yourself. or make some thing better on it.

so, Without specialists, a progress of society is nearly impossible. Because of this, specialiced knowledge is very important. general knowledge can received from books, but special knowledge is hard to get to know on your own.",
"In fact, I do not agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. What is the reason to support my point?
	 In the point of the company, the purpose of advertisements is to promote their  products. Of course they will advertise their products perfect to attract more customers to purchase them.Only in that way, they could gain more benifit to their company. So here comes the trickness. Instead of telling the weakness of thier products to the customers, the company just repeats the goodness of them. After all, the expence of the advertisements and marketing is extremely high. For instance, the cost of advertisement in TV is charged per second. In order to reach the best profit , absolutely they must make the products the best. Therefore, it would not hard to understand that why products seem so wonderful in the advertisement.
	In other way, customers chose what they are going to buy by the introduction of advertisement. As what we mentions about the company's concern, it is a huge difference between what customer needs and what company wants! 
	So what is the best way for both customers and companies? It would be better if customers could check the detailed more deeply before buying the products and the company should tell us more during theadvitisement",
"It is undeniable that advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of goods and services, making them appear far more desirable than they truly are. This tendency stems from the inherent nature of advertising, which aims to persuade and entice consumers. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They often highlight only the positive aspects of a product, while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks.

By presenting a carefully curated image, advertisers create an illusion of perfection that can be misleading. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. They may use heartwarming stories, humorous scenarios, or aspirational imagery to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. These emotional triggers can cloud consumers' judgment and make them more susceptible to the persuasive power of advertising.

"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are transformed into objects of desire. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image, often exaggerating their qualities. This tendency to embellish reality is a common practice in the advertising industry, and it is a strategy that often proves successful in attracting consumers.


One of the most prevalent tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. By highlighting only the positive aspects of a product and downplaying or omitting its drawbacks, they create a distorted perception of its true nature. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might showcase individuals with dramatic transformations, while failing to mention the potential side effects or the need for lifestyle changes. This selective presentation can mislead consumers into believing that the product is a magical solution, when in reality, it may be far less effective. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to sway consumers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, they create an association between the product and positive emotions. This emotional connection can overshadow rational decision-making, leading consumers to purchase products that they may not truly need or desire. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous woman surrounded by admirers, suggesting that using the perfume will make the consumer equally alluring. This emotional manipulation can be highly effective, but it can also create unrealistic expectations and lead to disappointment. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, many rely on exaggeration and emotional manipulation to make products seem more appealing than they actually are.

While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. Most advertisements, in my opinion, tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, creating an idealized image that often falls short of reality. 

One compelling reason for this exaggeration lies in the competitive nature of the market. Companies strive to differentiate themselves from rivals and capture consumers' attention. To achieve this, they often employ persuasive language, exaggerated claims, and carefully selected imagery that highlights the most desirable aspects of their products while downplaying any flaws. For instance, a beauty product advertisement might feature a model with flawless skin, implying that using the product will guarantee similar results. However, in reality, the model's appearance is likely enhanced by makeup, lighting, and post-production editing. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. They may evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, associating these emotions with the product being advertised. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on feelings rather than rational considerations. A car advertisement, for example, might showcase a family enjoying a scenic road trip, suggesting that owning the car will bring similar joy and adventure. However, the reality is that owning a car involves responsibilities, maintenance costs, and potential traffic congestion. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often present a distorted view of reality.

"Certain people believe that young people enjoy life more that older people do. On the other hand some people disagree with the idea of young people enjoying life more than older people do. In my personal opition, I strongly agree with the fact that younger people have relatively more time to enjoy life than old people do for several reasons according to the amount of responsibility, energy and time. 	

	One of the major reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older poeple do is closely related to the amount of responsibilities that older people and younger people have. In my opinion, getting older means receiving more responsibility. Based on my personal experience, as a high school student, I used to play games, meet friends, and did not worry that much on my future. However, as I grow older, I started to feel pressure, get responsibility and worry about my future which I have to prepare from now on. As a result, I strongly agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more that older people do.

	Another main reason that young people enjoy life more than older people is based on the amount of energy that young people and old people can spend and enjoy. For example, based on my personal experience, I used to eager to travel and visit foreign contries when I was young. However, as a grow older and I receive more responsibility, I started to get lazy about enjoying life. In addition, I put the studying primary than enjoying my life. It is the reason why most parents sacrify their enjoy for their children because they have the responsibility of being parents.

	Last but not least, another huge reason that young people enjoy life more that older people is closely connected with the amount of time that young people and older people contain. As I stated above, as people grow older, more responsibilities they get. Therefore, older people will have less time to enjoy their leisure time.

	Based on the amount of responsibility, energy and time, I strongly agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more that older people do. Therefore, I would recommend young people to enjoy their life before they grow older.",
"Humankind lives for the pursuit of happiness as long as it has got rid of what could seem to us a trivial point : the struggle for survival. Kant affirms that the doxa happiness has nothing in common with what philosophers considered as happiness. According to the doxa, eg, the common opinion, people have reached happiness when they could enjoy freely life. To be happy all life long you need to enjoy all life long. Nonetheless, even this restricted vision of happiness doesn't seem easy to reach. When are we able to freely enjoy in our life? Can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do?
	
	First we may consider indeed that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The mantra of youth could be : Life is short, party hard. They are young, they have many time to spend. Their behaviour toward life is therefore candide, they have no responsabilities. They think they are able to do whatever they want, even faults, thanks to the fact that they are young. So they enjoy life in their way : overdrinking, overdancing... No matter, they are inconscious!
	Nonetheless, this is a very contemporan phenomenon. For centuries until the fifties, youngs should work in the very begining of their life. They were not considered at all as  king-child as we do. Such a statement should have seemed to everybody aukward : the only period of the life one could have been able to enjoy, if not belonging to the high part of society, was the elderly when they had enough money to think to someting else than working.

	Nowdays things are different but I don't think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. They should enjoy life louder but that's it. Older people have learned to enjoy life differently, for instance by building a family or taking care of it, by enjoying every single moment of what we could call happiness.",
"There is an old saying that if you can not be the best be the best of what you are Which i thing true if you concern the acedemic conditions poeple living in Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may have advantages as far as technical or culturel any other knowledge but it may leave you directionless and without a view of future planning
	What if you have 3 diplomas and no job Simple but interesting argument You might be the most intellectual person on the planet Will it serve any purpose I dont think so if you have spent all those years studying examining or academically active True there is an aspect of personal indulgence but that is a rare case in my opinion For example you may have the information ability and resource to build a space craft Will you be able to pilot it or is it sense building it or flying that motivates one It is hard to answer but i would say the way you best is the shortest way when you consider someone spending years learning all that knowledge without feeling not even a small desire to fly
	For someone who specialised in one specific subject for example a mechanical engineer It is easier to appreciate the things he or she might accomplish That person will surely know devotion to his or her job or field of experty all because of one thing That person will keep everthing on a personal level knowing that someone else is doing something else important at very same level of concentration at something like a research or a development
	There are exceptions of course like the modern geniuses like Einstein but do we all have that leve of iq Is it safe the concertrate on everything rather than one thing at the point you are giving your live a direction No one wants be left without out a vision because he or she have too many before they realise  that they have to make a choice",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and uncertainties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming and stressful. Additionally, young adults may struggle with identity formation, relationship challenges, and the fear of the unknown. These factors can significantly impact their overall well-being and limit their ability to fully embrace life's pleasures. 

Conversely, older individuals have often achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment. They have gained valuable life experiences, built strong relationships, and may have achieved their career aspirations. This sense of accomplishment and security can contribute to a greater sense of contentment and enjoyment. Moreover, older people often have more time and freedom to pursue their passions, travel, and spend time with loved ones. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is subjective and influenced by a multitude of factors beyond age. While youth may offer certain advantages, such as physical vitality and a sense of possibility, older individuals possess a wealth of wisdom, experience, and a more nuanced perspective on life. Both stages of life have their unique joys and challenges, and it is unfair to generalize about which group enjoys life more. ",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. However, the statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" holds a significant degree of truth. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, many employ persuasive techniques that exaggerate or distort reality to create an idealized image. 

One common tactic used by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often highlight the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals who have achieved dramatic results, but fail to mention the possible side effects or the need for lifestyle changes. This selective focus creates a misleading impression of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. They may use heartwarming stories, celebrity endorsements, or aspirational imagery to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. These emotional triggers can cloud judgment and make consumers more susceptible to purchasing products that may not actually meet their needs. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous woman enjoying a romantic evening, suggesting that using the product will lead to similar experiences. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be informative and truthful, many rely on deceptive tactics to make products appear more desirable than they truly are. By selectively presenting information, employing emotional appeals, and creating unrealistic expectations, advertisers can manipulate consumer perceptions and influence purchasing decisions. It is essential for consumers to be aware of these techniques and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"Although many people think older people cannot enjoy life as much as younger, I think they can.
Often one thinks that old people are bored. Almost everyone can talk about Grandma looking out of the window the whole day watching unknown people passing the street. Of course not all Grandmas do that. But what about the younger ones? Is it not true that a lot of them sit in front of a TV half a day and watch unknown persons discussing in a talk show. Would not many consider watching TV to be amusement? The Grandma at the window might as well have fun and probably she thinks the younger ones are bored because they need to watch TV. Maybe for her the man that passes by all day at 10:30 and is always in a rush means a big fascination...
Still it leaves the point that not many old persons are observerd in discos, rock concerts or in the movies. But the other way round not many young people are seen in theaters, hiking in the nature or in the cinema when the old Western movie from 1950 is shown. Maybe drinking a tea in a silent undisturbed atmosphere is great enjoyment for the older, while younger prefer to drink a coke with loud Rock music in the background. There are of course many more examples, but those are rather dependant on the lifestyle and personal likes and dislikes people develope while getting older, than to the total amount of enjoyment they offer to differently aged groups.
In my view it is a bit too general to discuss just old and young, it just does not take into account the many varieties life has to offer. Each person is individually different and general views might fit for many but not for every single human being. Nevertheless as discussed above I think that there are different ways of enjoying life and those are quite different, if compared to people at different ages. But ultimately the level of enjoyment people get from life does not depend on the age and is therefore equal for the old and young.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, equating this to a greater enjoyment of life overlooks the multifaceted nature of happiness and the unique experiences that come with age. 

Firstly, young people often experience a heightened sense of novelty and adventure. The world is new and exciting, filled with opportunities for exploration and self-discovery. This can lead to a feeling of intense joy and fulfillment. However, this stage of life is also marked by uncertainty and instability. The pressure to succeed, build a career, and establish oneself can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety.

Conversely, older individuals have often navigated life's challenges and achieved a sense of stability. They have built strong relationships, established careers, and gained wisdom through experience. This can lead to a deeper appreciation for the simple pleasures of life, such as spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, and contributing to society. While they may not experience the same level of physical energy as younger people, they often possess a greater sense of contentment and peace.
Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is subjective and varies greatly from person to person, regardless of age. While youth may have a certain advantage in terms of physical energy and novelty, older individuals have a wealth of experience and wisdom that can contribute to a fulfilling and enjoyable life. To say that one age group enjoys life more than another is a reductionist view that fails to acknowledge the complex and nuanced nature of human experience.",
"I strongly agree with the given statement. I think we usually misleaded by some advertisements or commercials.There are many example for supporting my perspectives.

    First of all, componies always want to promot their product for maximize their profit. We can see many kinds of diet pill advertisements on magzine  or commercials on telvesion. The advertisements always said the diet pill can really works dramatically, but after people buy and use it, they feel they have cheated. Because many componies just want a good marketing for their products. They do not really care customers, even overexaggrating their products.

    Additionally, the advertisement have to show advantages of the product, it will never said anything about disadvantages. We usually see some body-building machine on telvesion commercial. However, we also see many our friends bought a body-building machine, but did not really use it. They often realized that machine is too big or",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial, fostering adaptability, critical thinking, and a holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In our rapidly evolving world, careers and industries are constantly shifting. Someone with a wide range of knowledge can readily transition between fields, applying their understanding of different disciplines to solve new problems. For example, a historian with a background in economics might be better equipped to analyze the historical impact of economic policies than someone solely focused on history. 

Secondly, a broad education fosters critical thinking skills. By encountering diverse perspectives and subject matter, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify biases, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking is essential for navigating a complex world filled with competing ideas and information overload. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base allows for a more holistic understanding of the world. By connecting different disciplines, individuals can see the interconnectedness of various phenomena. For instance, understanding the principles of physics can shed light on the workings of the human body, while knowledge of history can provide context for current events. This holistic perspective fosters a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the world and encourages a more nuanced approach to problem-solving. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more adaptable, critical, and holistic approach to learning and life. By embracing a wide range of subjects, individuals can better navigate the complexities of the modern world and contribute meaningfully to society.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization in a specific subject offers profound expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and equips individuals with a more holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts across different disciplines. For instance, a student with a strong foundation in history can better understand the social and political context of literary works. Similarly, an understanding of economics can shed light on the motivations behind historical events. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge and promotes a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. By encountering diverse perspectives and methodologies, individuals develop the ability to analyze information objectively, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This critical thinking is essential for navigating the complexities of the modern world, where information is readily available but often unreliable.
Finally, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals with diverse skills and the ability to learn new things quickly. A broad education provides a solid foundation for acquiring new knowledge and adapting to evolving demands.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and valuable educational experience. It fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and equips individuals with the adaptability and resilience necessary to thrive in a complex and ever-changing world. By embracing a broad education, we can cultivate well-rounded individuals who are better equipped to understand and contribute to the world around them.",
"As science and technology develops, societies burden people with a huge amount of knowledge. An important question arises for each individual, when he tries to build an amount of knowledge for himself: Is it better for him to concentrate on a subject and has a unified knowledge on that subject, or is it better for him to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I think, it is better to choose a subject and concentrate on its details.
   First, during my undergraduate years, I tried take classes from as broad subjects as I can. I took economy, physics, classical ballet, history of science and german litretare courses as  my elective courses. In this way, I have gained knowledge on each of these subjects. But I could study each of them for at most two successive semesters. That's why I could gain only a little information on each of them. Now I still have curiosity to further improve my knowledge on many of these topics, but I could not have time and energy to accomplish such a great task.
    Second, the number of academic subjects increases in an incredible speed. What is called broad today, will not even be enough tomorrow. And the amount of knowledge that has to be gained on a topic in order to have an idea of it will also increase as time passes. So, it is also very diffucult to develop a good and broad knowledge of various academic topics.
      Last, but not the least is that, a person is required to find a job to survive. So, he has to have adequate knowledge in one specific subject in order to be able to work on this subject. And it will be better for him to concentrate on the topic he works on.
      All in all, to have a broad knowledge of many subjects seems attractive. However, it may be an impossible goal to achieve.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that older individuals lack the capacity for joy and fulfillment. In fact, both age groups have unique experiences and perspectives that contribute to their overall enjoyment of life. 

Young people often experience life with a sense of novelty and excitement. They are exploring new experiences, building relationships, and pursuing their passions. This sense of discovery can lead to a heightened sense of joy and fulfillment. For example, a young person graduating from college and embarking on their first career may feel a surge of excitement and anticipation for the future. However, this period of life can also be marked by uncertainty, financial instability, and the pressure to succeed. 

Older people, on the other hand, have had the opportunity to accumulate wisdom, experience, and a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. They have weathered life's storms and learned valuable lessons along the way. This perspective can lead to a sense of contentment and appreciation for the simple things in life. For instance, an older person who has raised a family and witnessed their children's successes may find immense joy in spending time with their grandchildren and sharing their life stories. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that varies greatly from person to person, regardless of age. While young people may have the advantage of youthful exuberance, older people possess the wisdom and perspective that comes with time. Both age groups have the potential to experience joy and fulfillment in their own unique ways. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that one group enjoys life more than the other.",
"I disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communties, because of two reasons. Here are my reasons.

       Firs, if one person doesn't want to give his enough time to help other people that means he is selffish. I jointed a interview process and new hired people training of my company. In my opinion,If there are two people at the siminar work position. The better man always be the one who pay more time to help other people. The God always helps the one who loves help other people. The one who loves pay more time to help people. He will get the feedback of others. You never know when will other people feedback your help. 

      Once I worked in a local campany, but I always help people and do some volunteer works on patient group. Till I want to work at a Global company. Some people help me to get interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company. Give enough time to helping communtites not only gives me peace, lovely feeling but also give me wild view to see the world.

      Second, I can see the gap of salary in my country becomes biger and biger. This big gap brings some public security problems. The rich person affrid to be hostage, the poor people don't have money to give their child well education. Why don't we give enough time to helping our communities? Give the poor person help to educate, get work and resept. We will not have much more public problem. Moreover we will feel happy and lovely.

       According these two reasons, I disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping communities. Young people are like sponge. What you teach them what you earn. Moreover young people have to study and they have ability to care other communities. Give enough time to helping communtites is a win-win solution to makes our world better and lovely.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, equating this to greater enjoyment is a flawed assumption. Both young and old experience life's joys and sorrows, and the perception of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout one's lifespan. 

Firstly, young people often prioritize immediate gratification and novelty. They relish the thrill of new experiences, from exploring new hobbies to traveling to exotic destinations. This sense of adventure and discovery can indeed be exhilarating. However, it's important to acknowledge that older individuals may find fulfillment in different ways, such as cultivating deep relationships, pursuing lifelong passions, or contributing to their communities. These experiences, while less flashy, can be equally, if not more, fulfilling. 

Secondly, the concept of 'enjoyment' is subjective and influenced by individual circumstances. A young person may be ecstatic about a new job, while an older person may find contentment in their established career. A young person might be overwhelmed by the pressure of societal expectations, while an older person may feel liberated from such constraints.
The experience of joy is not solely determined by age, but by personal values, priorities, and life experiences. 

In conclusion, attributing greater enjoyment to youth is an oversimplification. While young people may experience life with a certain zest, older individuals often find fulfillment in different ways. The perception of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life, making it impossible to definitively declare one age group as experiencing more joy than another.
Ultimately, the capacity for enjoyment is inherent in all individuals, regardless of their age.",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a topic of much debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.


Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By understanding concepts from various disciplines, individuals can approach challenges from multiple perspectives. For example, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the causes of historical events, while a scientist with an understanding of literature might be able to communicate their findings more effectively. This interdisciplinary approach allows for more comprehensive and innovative solutions. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base promotes adaptability and resilience in a constantly changing world. As technology advances and industries shift, individuals with specialized skills may find themselves limited in their career options. However, those with a broad understanding of different fields can readily adapt to new challenges and opportunities. For instance, a person with a background in both technology and business might be well-suited to navigate the evolving landscape of the digital economy. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches personal growth and intellectual curiosity. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and develop a more nuanced perspective. This intellectual stimulation fosters a lifelong love of learning and a desire to continuously expand one's horizons. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It promotes critical thinking, adaptability, and personal growth, making it a valuable asset in today's complex and ever-changing world. By embracing a diverse range of knowledge, individuals can become more well-rounded, adaptable, and intellectually engaged citizens.",
"Is not about the age, is about the vision and the experience the reason because the young  and older people do and think about different things.
When you are young, you think in study, work to get money for spent with friends, go to parties, do not obbey the older people, and do anything that you want. The teenagers think about their friends, the clothes that use, the fashion, the TV, the games. They are worried about live the moments, no matters the consecuences of their acts and the family is only the group of persons that wait for they at home, and give them money. 
With the years and the experience, the vision of the life change, you think in get a real job which allows you to get all staff you need, you think to get a couple wich share the time and you initially, do not want childs.
When you become older you already have a family a home, and think so much the way to care about their. You think and work for your children finish the school and go to the University, and you live only for your family. They thinks about prevention.

Precisely because the older people enjoy their youth (in most cases) do not think in do the same things, they are looking for the better conditions for finish their lifes.

For me, is not that the young people enjoy life more than olders, is just that have another different point of view about life. Only the experience that can get with every moment along their lifes can modify that shallow vision and transform it in a mature vision of the life and the world that allows to be a grown up person. 
Just the time and the things you live, can change your vision of the life.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibilities, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, like exploring new experiences and pursuing passions, may not hold the same appeal for an older individual who values stability and contentment. For instance, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive greater pleasure from spending time with their family and tending to their garden.

Secondly, the challenges and anxieties faced by young people can significantly impact their enjoyment of life. The pressure to succeed academically, professionally, and socially can be overwhelming, leading to stress and uncertainty. Older individuals, having navigated these challenges, may have a more balanced perspective and a greater appreciation for the simple joys of life.

Finally, the notion that older people are less capable of enjoying life is a harmful stereotype. Many older individuals remain active, engaged, and passionate about their pursuits. They have the wisdom and experience to appreciate the nuances of life and find joy in unexpected places.

In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain energy and freedom, it is unfair and inaccurate to claim they enjoy life more than older people. Enjoyment is a subjective experience that evolves throughout life, and both young and old can find fulfillment and happiness in their own unique ways.

"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in community service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-ups to food banks, they dedicate their time and energy to addressing local issues. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led climate change activism showcases their commitment to creating a better future for their communities. These individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices to advocate for change, demonstrating a deep understanding of their community's needs. 

Furthermore, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to make a difference. Many are using their technological expertise to develop innovative solutions for social problems. For example, young programmers are creating apps that connect volunteers with those in need, while social media influencers are using their platforms to raise awareness about important causes. These initiatives highlight the creative and resourceful nature of young people, who are finding new ways to contribute to their communities. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From traditional volunteer work to innovative technological solutions, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact. To truly understand their commitment, we must look beyond generalizations and acknowledge the countless examples of their dedication and service.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth often brings a sense of boundless energy and freedom, it is a mistake to assume that older individuals are incapable of experiencing joy and fulfillment. In fact, both age groups have unique advantages and challenges that shape their perspectives on life. 

One argument in favor of the statement is that young people are less burdened by responsibilities. They are free to explore their passions, travel, and experiment with different lifestyles without the constraints of a career, family, or financial obligations. This freedom allows them to embrace new experiences and live in the moment, which can certainly contribute to a sense of enjoyment. For example, a young backpacker traveling through Southeast Asia might experience a level of excitement and adventure that a retired individual, settled in their home town, might not. 

However, older people often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and have learned to appreciate the simple things. They have weathered storms and overcome challenges, developing resilience and wisdom along the way. This perspective allows them to find joy in the everyday moments, such as spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or simply enjoying a quiet evening at home. For instance, a retired teacher who dedicates their time to volunteering and mentoring young people might find immense fulfillment in helping others and making a difference in their community. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is subjective and influenced by individual circumstances and perspectives. While youth may offer a sense of freedom and adventure, older individuals often possess a deeper appreciation for life's nuances and find joy in different ways. It is unfair and inaccurate to claim that one age group enjoys life more than the other.

"I do not agree with the  statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do.
Firstly,I think that  to enjoy life has nothing to do with the age.Older people can enjoy life as much as young people do .Sometimes older people even know more about how to enjoy life and enjoy life  more because they are older than the young people and realize what is more precious to the life.  For example, when my mother was young ,she wanted to earn more money and brought  up the child in a big house.She worked hard .She had little  time to stay with the children.When she was old, the children all left and went to  university in another city or even in another country. She realized that she would have spent more time with the children when the children stayed at home if she had been  young again.Obviously nothing is more delightful and memorable than to enjoy yourself with your dear childrens.There are also many examples that the young people regret the days that they would enjoy the life better.
Secondly ,we have many  ways to enjoy the life.The ways are  not better  or worse .They are not less or more.Young people may want to dance ,to sing ,to skate or  to climb the mountain.Older people prefer reading ,watching television or just  watching the sunset  by the sea.During the different period in our life , we have different ways to enjoy life.Life can be as active as a tiger and life can  also be quiet and calm as a small river.We enjoy life in the different period.When we are young,we want to challenge and to take risk.When we are older,we can enjoy the peacefulness and normal happines in the life.
In a word,I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .It is not a question of age .In fact ,it is a question of attitude.We can enjoy life in any stage of our life as long as we know how to appreciate the beauty  of the life and to   cherish what we have possessed.",
"The term ""Knowledge"" as we see has a ample number of branches to be described.One such branch that we are about to see is that of a students academics.A man is simply a learner in his own life.
Lets consider the case of an individual when he is in childhood stage.As a child he learns to crawl,eat,play etc.In this context he is a learner to go through all the varied functionalities associated to him.Later comes the stage of being a grown up boy.Here would prefer to walk on  the ground rather than crawling,thus his interest has got confined.
                        In a similar way when we consider the case of a individual pursuing his academics.Its would be better to excel in one specific subject rather than going through various subjects.This would be beneficial not only to the individual but also to the career that he opts for.Consider the case of an Engineer,if he is made to go through the subjects like, Politics,Medicine etc. then it would be infered that the chances of becoming an Engineer are bleak. The same case may not be applicable to all other cases.When we take the above case of an sucessful Engeineer we can clearly state in the maximum cases that,the inividual has had a plenty of overview of his interest and the subjects that he has studied.
On the other hand a person with only confined knowledge would excel only in his choosed field rather than being aware of the happenings around him.Lets take the case of any political leaders.As we know leaders are not born as leaders,they are the people coming from different fields.A leader may be a doctor,engineer,farmer etc.So the individual as a leader has to be aware of all the happenings going around him and also his region,province,country etc.Thus here in this case we can say that a mere confined knowledge is not enough to be a perfect individual.

                          So we can say that the method of having a broad knowlege of academic subjects depends upon how an individual approaches it ,rather than making it a controversial methodology",
"I agree with the statement in which it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. There is several reasons why I think so.
 First, if you have broad knowleadge of many kinds of academic subjects, you can communicate with many kinds of people. In other words, you can talk with a person who are studying international politics and economics and laws if you have any knowledge. In opposite side, if you have only knowledge of laws, you can't talk with a person learning about economics.
 Second, by gaining widespread knowledge, you can be interested in various subjects. I think that's so nice. If you have interest in various subjects, then you will have more ways you can choose in your life than a person who has interest in only one thing. 
 Finally, we should get as much knowleadge as possible while we are living. I think knowing is growing, so we can grow until die.",
"I agree with statement  young people enjoy  life more than the old people .The young people  can enjoy more than the old people due to the following reasons.

First young people have more place to explore when compared to old people.To explore these new places young have lots of energy and enjoyment by exploring that places.Incontrast old who might have already visited that places will less entusiasm and excitement when compared to the young people.

second,most of old people will be suffering from chronic diseases like diabates,bloodpressure,and heart related diseases so old people suffering from these disease cannot enjoy as much as young people who are more resistant to these chronic diseases.		


	Moreover financial problems are more for old people when compared to young people because old people will not have sufficient energy to work so they cant earn money to spend it on different amusements for enjoying thier life.on the otherhand young people with lots of energy can work more and  can earn more so that they can spend on different amusements to enjoy thier life. 

so old people cannot enjoy the life as much as the young people because they have financial problems ,they may be suffering from chronic diseases moreover they dont have so much energy to enjoy thier life when compared to the energetic young people.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young individuals contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives addressing social issues. From organizing environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice, young people are using their energy and creativity to make a positive impact. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their commitment to creating a better future.

Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time at local organizations, contributing to the well-being of their communities. From assisting at soup kitchens to mentoring underprivileged children, their efforts provide invaluable support to those in need. These acts of kindness and compassion demonstrate a genuine desire to make a difference in the lives of others.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about an entire generation, it's crucial to recognize the diverse contributions of young people. Their involvement in community service, whether through activism, volunteering, or other forms of engagement, proves that they are actively shaping a more just and equitable society.

"How many times do you see advertisements a day?  Recently we live in the flood of advertisements and it is true that sometimes they can be very useful information to buy something new. However, it is not good to trust every fact which is in the advertisement. Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

	Showing their product seem better than they really are can be considered as a marketing strategy. There are too many products which have the same function in the world, and if they want to sell their products, they need to make the advertisement of their product which has the same function but has to seem much better than other products. The problem is from that point. They decide to lie in order to sell their product more and the customers who buy that product wil be cheated.

	I had an experience to buy a set of equipments for cooking. In the television advertisement, it looked like magic. Show-hosts could to everything with those eqipments easily and it worked very well on tv. And also the product was much cheapper than other products which were selled in real shops. However, I could not do anything well with the same equipments. The knives which had special purposes were worse than a knife which I had used before them, and I could use several types of pots and pans only for two or three months. And then, I had to buy new equipments.

	Even though it is true that advertisements are necessary to show someone's products widely and easily, there should be only truth in the advertisements.",
"I agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

I have two following reasons:

First of all, to enjoy life leads young people to think by theirself what to do to enjoy and how can they make it. Because to enjoy is not the things given by other people, young people have to abount how does they make the things ejoyable. To think by myself makes charactor of young people agressive. It is important for young people to make and produce their own charactor as early  as possible in their life.  To think  that way is very useful for young people.    

Second reason is that the feeling enjoy is gotten by various kind of the experienments. This process that young people challenge and experience many things and fell enjoy through such challlenges and experiments is  very useful in the growth of young people.  In fact, older people may challenge and experience many things also, but in view of the importance gained through such experiments, it is more neccessary for young people to enjoy life.

As I mentioned above, I definitely agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, it is a mistake to assume that happiness is solely a product of age. Both young and old individuals can experience profound joy and fulfillment, albeit in different ways. 

Firstly, young people often face a unique set of pressures that can hinder their enjoyment of life. The constant pursuit of education, career advancement, and financial stability can create a sense of overwhelming responsibility. Additionally, the social pressures of fitting in and achieving success can lead to anxiety and stress. In contrast, older individuals may have already achieved a level of stability and security that allows them to focus on personal fulfillment and leisure activities. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. What brings joy to a young person, such as exploring new experiences and pursuing romantic relationships, may hold less appeal to an older individual who values stability and meaningful connections. Older people may find satisfaction in nurturing relationships, pursuing hobbies, and contributing to their communities. 

Finally, it is important to recognize that happiness is not a constant state. Both young and old individuals experience periods of joy and sorrow, and the ability to navigate these ups and downs is a crucial aspect of a fulfilling life. While young people may have a more carefree outlook, older individuals have gained wisdom and resilience through their life experiences, which can equip them to handle challenges and appreciate the good times even more. 

In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification. Both age groups have their own unique challenges and opportunities for happiness. Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a personal journey that evolves throughout our lives, and it is impossible to definitively say that one age group experiences more joy than another.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers profound expertise in a chosen field, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual flexibility, cultivates a holistic understanding of the world, and equips individuals with the adaptability necessary to navigate an ever-evolving landscape.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas across disciplines, fostering innovative thinking. For instance, a historian with a grasp of economics can better understand the social and economic forces that shaped historical events. Similarly, a scientist with a background in literature can analyze scientific advancements through the lens of human values and ethics. This interdisciplinary approach encourages creative problem-solving and leads to more comprehensive solutions.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates a well-rounded perspective on the world. By exploring diverse subjects, individuals gain a deeper understanding of different cultures, ideologies, and perspectives. This exposure broadens their horizons, fosters empathy, and promotes tolerance. In a globalized world, such a holistic understanding is crucial for effective communication and collaboration.
Finally, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the adaptability necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing world. As technology advances and industries evolve, the skills required for success are constantly shifting. Individuals with a broad education are better equipped to adapt to these changes, as they possess a diverse skillset and a flexible mindset. They can readily transition between fields, embrace new challenges, and contribute meaningfully to a dynamic society.
In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters intellectual flexibility, cultivates a holistic understanding of the world, and equips individuals with the adaptability necessary to navigate an ever-evolving landscape. By embracing a broad education, we empower ourselves to become more informed, adaptable, and engaged citizens of the world.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of goods, making them appear far more desirable than they truly are. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to buy. 

One compelling example of this phenomenon is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing in beauty advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve flawless skin, perfect proportions, and unrealistic features. This manipulation creates an unattainable standard of beauty, leading consumers to believe that the products advertised will magically transform them into the idealized image. In reality, these products may offer minimal benefits, but the exaggerated portrayal in advertising creates a false sense of hope and desirability. 

Furthermore, advertisements often employ persuasive language and emotional appeals to evoke positive associations with products. For instance, a car commercial might depict a sleek, luxurious vehicle cruising along scenic roads with a happy family inside. This imagery evokes feelings of freedom, adventure, and family bonding, associating these positive emotions with the car itself. However, the reality is that the car may be expensive to maintain, prone to mechanical issues, and ultimately fail to deliver on the promised emotional benefits. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately reflect the qualities of products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits and create a distorted perception of reality. The use of airbrushing, persuasive language, and emotional appeals all contribute to this tendency, leading consumers to believe that products are more desirable and effective than they truly are. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"The evolution of humanity and society is a curios phenomena and it is still in progress. I believe that one of the most important elements of modern society is the division of labor. That is how humanity managed to evolve and advance. Therefore, I strongly argue that it is better to specialize in one specific subject. In order to clarify and explain this thesis statement, this essay will first explain the advantages of division of labor and consequently focusing one particular area of concentration. Then it will point out the drawbacks of studying on multiple academic subjects.

The division of labor means basically that certain people will work or specialize in certain tasks or issue areas. For example a normal city would have seperate police department, firefighting department and medical centers. People who work in these different jobs would be trained accordingly. It is pretty much the same for the academic subjects. A person who receives a proper medical education and training would not be the ideal candidate for a further education for education or architecture.

Secondly, in order to have broad knowledge on many different subjects requires so much education and training that probably a period one lifetime would not be sufficient. There is also a very good chance that people will lack the reqired drive and enthusiasim or simply the interest to study and work hard in order to gain knowledge in various issue areas.

Also people are generally good at certain things. For example, I feel confident about my skills on social scinces. I like to read, listen and discuss international relations. However, I have never been good at maths no matter how hard I try. In other words, people like me may just lack the talent or the capacity to succeed in multiple and disparate areas of academic subjects.

As a result of all the pittfalls mentioned above about the multi-disciplinarity and the obvious advantages of the specialization on one area of concentration I firmly believe that people should work on one subject and master it.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance and a sense of limitless possibilities, claiming that they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, such as pursuing new experiences or engaging in social activities, may not hold the same appeal for an older individual who values stability, family, and personal fulfillment.
For instance, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive greater joy from spending time with their grandchildren or pursuing a long-held passion.
Secondly, the challenges and responsibilities of life often increase with age. Older people may face financial pressures, health concerns, or the loss of loved ones, which can impact their overall enjoyment of life. However, these experiences can also lead to a deeper appreciation for the simple things and a greater sense of wisdom and perspective. 

Finally, it is important to recognize that happiness and enjoyment are not static concepts. They fluctuate throughout life, influenced by a myriad of factors.
A young person may be experiencing a period of intense joy, while an older person may be going through a difficult time.
To suggest that one age group inherently enjoys life more than another is simply not accurate.
In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain energy and optimism, claiming that they enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification.
Enjoyment is a subjective experience that varies greatly across individuals and throughout life.
Both young and old have the potential to find joy and fulfillment in their own unique ways.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them seem far better than they actually are. This tendency stems from the inherent nature of advertising, which aims to persuade and entice consumers. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information and misleading claims. For instance, advertisements for weight loss products often showcase individuals with dramatic transformations, implying that similar results can be achieved by using the product. However, these advertisements rarely disclose the rigorous exercise routines and dietary restrictions that contribute to the individuals' success. This selective presentation creates an illusion of effortless weight loss, which is rarely the case in reality. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and psychological manipulation to sway consumers. By using evocative imagery, catchy slogans, and celebrity endorsements, advertisers attempt to create an emotional connection with the product, associating it with positive feelings and aspirations. For example, advertisements for luxury cars frequently depict individuals driving through scenic landscapes or attending glamorous events, implying that owning the car will bring a sense of status, freedom, and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on unrealistic expectations. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority tend to present an idealized and exaggerated version of reality. By selectively showcasing information, employing emotional appeals, and using misleading claims, advertisers aim to create a perception of products that is often far removed from their actual qualities. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"There is no doubt in saying that advertisements shows products in much impressive than the actual products.There is  a saying in English,""First impression leaves better impression"".Manufactres wants to persuade people with perpetuating impression in the first instance itself.

First,Manufactures of soft drinks spend millions of dollars for promoting their drinks.Famous actrors or actress serve as brand ambassdor to their products to lure the customers .They claiam that  this is the best possible,energetic drink one can imagine.Infact it is not true.Just plane water could be more refreshing,rejuvineating  than soft drink.It is one of the leading cause of Diabetes mellitus,becuase it contains lot of sugar products.Some studies have shown that there are traces of pesticides in soft drink.Inspite of all this disadvanates they are promting thier products by attractive packaging  and advertising.

Second,now let us consider fast food advertisiments.Thier advertisements suggests that they are healthiest foods on can imagine.Howeer that is not the case.Each sandwitch in a restarant may contain more than 1000 Kcal.There is some recent strong evidence suggest that schooll  children in USA  are becoming obese  by eating restaurent food.We can see the pictures of the food on posters.It looks very appeeling.However we can not be sure hat are ingriednts,whwre it came from.How many times did they used same oil.I beacme ill several times after eating cafteria food.Single can of tuna and could be much  nutrious than high fat food avialable fast food hotels.

Third,Toy manufactures advertises attract lot of children by making wide range of toys.But mant cases toys would not be up to the eexpecation of child.Single piece of paper could have been more imaginatve than electronic toy.Because it might improve child drawing performance or writing ability.This sort of advanatge,however denied to the toys.

In conclusion,I am of the view that people should consdier adevrtisement as a source of information before before buying product.They should be carefull.",
"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Because that is the reason why the advertisements really are. In almost all advertisements we can see only the good sides of the product. We can only see the side effects or bad consequences only when there is any law or regulations that they should indicate them like tabbaco or medicine. Advertisers want to sell their product more and more and have to compete with the product of other companies. So they show the good-looking product with great function and hide the defects.
And another reason is that the advertisements are made in the best circumstances in which the product can function most effectively. For example, in the clothing advertisement we can see the idealy good shaped person wearing the product. And we imagine the look that we are going to have with that clothes similar to the advertisement and come to buy the product. That is why I agree with this statement.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, cultivates critical thinking, and equips individuals with a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts across different disciplines. For instance, a student with a strong foundation in history can better understand the social and political context of scientific advancements. Similarly, an understanding of literature can enrich one's appreciation of art and music. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of complex issues. 

Furthermore, a broad education encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By encountering diverse perspectives and methodologies, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This adaptability is crucial in today's rapidly changing world, where individuals are constantly confronted with new challenges and opportunities. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enhances one's ability to communicate effectively and engage in meaningful conversations. By being familiar with a wide range of subjects, individuals can contribute to discussions on diverse topics, understand different viewpoints, and build bridges across disciplines. This fosters intellectual growth and promotes a more inclusive and collaborative society. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and rewarding educational experience. It fosters intellectual curiosity, cultivates critical thinking, and equips individuals with the skills and perspectives necessary to navigate the complexities of the modern world.",
"With the advance of communication systems such as television and internet, access to information is becoming easier and easier. Therefore, it is not hard these days to find people with a little knowledge on a wide range of subjects.

Access to information has become easier not only for ten-year-old children but also for scientists as well. However, it is not the range of subjects one has knowledge on, but the depth of knowledge in a specific subject, when it comes to academics. The reason is many fold.

First of all, good academic work requires concentration, hard work, and above all, deep knowledge on the subject. It is of course true that having knowledge on many other subjects would help the researcher look at the subject, or the problem at hand from other points of view, but when it comes to actually producing good work, all that matters is expertize on the subject. Simply, one cannot produce original academic work without understanding the small details of the subject; be it the inner workings of a physical principle, or the French cuisine in middle class of the seventeenth century.

Another crucial reason as to one should specialize on the subject she is working on, rather than spending her time learning about other subjects is that in the end, one will have to convey his knowledge to the next generation. As this is the only way knowledge is accumulated, by passing from generation to generation, a researcher should always have a good understanding of the new discoveries in his field, which will require specializing on the subject. Only after having a deep knowledge on the subject can one let the next generation benefit from his background.

Having superficial knowledge about a broad range of subjects is like reading the first pages of thousands of books, hence does not contribute to one's wisdom or expertise. Compare that to someone who has only read Hemingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls'. It is not unreasonable at all to argue that the latter has gained a better wisdom from her experience.",
"for me it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, because if you have broad knowledge you always could make anything in any moment. if you have specific knowledge you are limited. in the world of the work if you have specific knowledge you will have more difficult to find a job than a person who have broadn knowledge.
i think that is more important have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because usually, for the work, is not required specialize knowledge in one specific subject.
well i think that for the person is more beautiful have broad knowledge of  many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because if you have more knowledge you can speak with any people you meet.
you could speak with various type of people. people who have different trucks of life. people who arrive to various places of the world and speak different languages. 
if you have specialize knowledge in one specific subject you may not understand other different subject very well because you don't have basic knowledge of other subject.

"The producers use advertisements to introduce the products to the consumers. The income of company depends on how much it sells its product by appealing effecitvely to the audience through advertisements. Also, certain company might be in a competition with another company, thus it would wish to make a better advertisement to sell more products. Because of these competitive natures of advertisement, the producers often make products seem much better than they actually are. 
	A company's main goal is to sell as much product as possible to grow economically. In order to sell a great number of products, a company first has to appeal to the consumers. By making advertisements that make products look much better than the actual product, a company can encourage the audience to at least come and look at their product. Even though the consumer may not buy the product, he or she will know about it since it appealed to them effectively through the advertisement. If the advertisement did not make the product look that great, the consumer would not even consider to come and see it. For example, an advertisement of a new car or a computer demonstrates that the product guarantees the consumer's satisfaction. However, any human made product is bound to have mistakes and some errors. When the consumer purchaes this newly advertised computer, he or she will soon discover some malfunctions which is not what the advertisement suggested. Because the company made such an appealing advertisement, it was able to sell its product, which was their primary goal.
	Another reason the company uses advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are is the competition with other companies. The competition causes the producer to want to discourage the consumers to buy the other company's products and only buy the product of his or hers. In order to cause this discouragement is to make an effective advertisement. To win the competition, an exaggeration of its product will not be the company's main concern. Thus, the company will willingly make its product look much better in its advertisement than it actually is. 
	The advertisements are the main means of communication betweenthe producers and the consumers. To sell more products and to survive in the competition with other companies, a certain company will not hesistate to make product seem much superior to the actual product.",
"Some people might say that young people spend their time enough helping  their commucities indicating the large numbers of charity clubs or volunteer communities. However, I think that, actually, young people do not concern about their communities. There are two major reasons: they are busy concerning about their own ways and they spend their time for their self-realization more and more.
	First of all, current society is so much competitive that young people should concern about their courses or ways shch as getting jobs or their study. To young people, what matters is not the helping activities for their communities, but to find their ways in such a complex and competitive society. As modern society is getting more complex, the role of young people has been changed. It might have been to help their communities before, but now it is to survive in the competitive society. Therefore, young people cannot afford to give their time to help their communities. Rather, they are busy trying to get a job or study hard on their ways.
	Moreover, even if young people have enough time, they spend their extra time for their own purpose. From leisure activities with their friends to self-realization, there are so many things that young people feels attractive to spend their time for. Even though some mignt think that this is undesirable, young people consider spending their time helping their communities out-of-dated. For example, when I was young, my uncles usually who were young at that time were engaged in some volunteer activities helping our communities, and spend their time much in doing those. However, now, I find my fiends are usually seeking to use their time on their own purpose such as hanging out with friends, practicing their foreign language skills, etc. Thus I think that, as time goes by, this current will be spread out more and more.
	In summary, I agree with the statement that young people do not spend their time helping their communities. Nowadays, young people concentrate on their own lives so much that they do not spend their time for their communities.",

"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, the social pressures of fitting in and navigating complex relationships can contribute to stress and uncertainty. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a greater sense of stability and fulfillment, having navigated these challenges and established a solid foundation for their lives. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment evolves with age and experience. While young people may find pleasure in fleeting experiences like parties and adventures, older individuals often derive satisfaction from deeper connections, meaningful relationships, and the pursuit of personal passions. They have the time and wisdom to appreciate the simple joys of life, such as spending time with loved ones, engaging in hobbies, and contributing to their communities. 

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that happiness is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. Some young individuals may be content with their lives, while others may struggle with feelings of dissatisfaction. Similarly, some older individuals may experience a sense of fulfillment and joy, while others may feel regret or loneliness. It is unfair and inaccurate to generalize about the enjoyment of life based solely on age. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with certain advantages, it is not a guarantee of greater enjoyment. Both young and old individuals experience a range of emotions and find happiness in different ways.

The true measure of enjoyment lies in the individual's perspective and their ability to find meaning and fulfillment in their own lives.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, creating an idealized image that often fails to reflect reality. 

One compelling reason for this discrepancy lies in the inherent nature of advertising. Advertisers are primarily concerned with generating sales and maximizing profits. To achieve this goal, they often employ persuasive techniques that emphasize the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might showcase its sleek design and advanced features, but it might fail to mention its limited battery life or its susceptibility to overheating. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on visual and auditory cues to create an emotional connection with the viewer. By using attractive models, catchy jingles, and evocative imagery, advertisers aim to evoke feelings of desire, excitement, and even envy. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on superficial impressions rather than rational assessments of the product's true value. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately depict products, the vast majority tend to present a distorted and overly positive view. By employing persuasive techniques, emotional appeals, and selective information, advertisers create an idealized image that often fails to match the reality of the product. Consumers should be aware of these tactics and exercise caution when making purchasing decisions based solely on advertising.",
"The question wheather it is generally really better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is not easy to answer since it depends highly on the context. 
Undergraduate study courses should indeed offer the students a variety of subjects so they gain a broad knowledge of different areas. Then, this knowledge can function as a basis to specialize in postgraduate studies. 
I consider both the gain of broad knowledge as a first step and the specialization in one subject as a second step to be very important for the following reasons: 
On the one hand, due to technical invention, among others the improved communication means, contemporary knowledge is growing faster than ever before in the past. No human is able to learn everything that has been discovered by scientists so far. In conclusion, the attempt to gain a deeper knowledge in each academic area must fail. One can only gain a deep knowledge in very limited subjects. 
Therefore, specialization is necessary since science need researchers who are experts in the area they are working.
On the other hand, for the same reason that the world is much more connected than it used to be, there is also the need for every student to have a basic knowledge of other areas than the one he is specializing in for different sciences are more connected and work together more often  than in the past.
In conclusion, basic broad knowledge is necessary as a basis to specialize in one certain area.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and prepares individuals for a rapidly evolving world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base cultivates intellectual curiosity. Exposure to diverse subjects sparks a thirst for understanding and encourages individuals to explore new ideas and perspectives. For instance, studying history alongside literature can provide a deeper understanding of the social and cultural context in which literary works were created. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the world.
Secondly, a broad education enhances critical thinking skills. By encountering different perspectives and methodologies across various disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This critical thinking is essential for navigating complex issues and making informed decisions in a world saturated with information.
Finally, a broad knowledge base prepares individuals for a rapidly evolving world. In today's dynamic society, adaptability and the ability to learn new skills are paramount. A broad education provides a foundation for lifelong learning, allowing individuals to readily adapt to changing circumstances and embrace new opportunities. For example, a student with a broad background in science and technology may be better equipped to transition into a career in artificial intelligence, a field that is rapidly evolving.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and adaptable approach to learning. It fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and prepares individuals for the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world. By embracing a diverse range of knowledge, we can become more well-rounded individuals and better equipped to navigate the complexities of the 21st century.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and amplifying their impact. For instance, the recent surge in online activism surrounding environmental issues demonstrates the power of young people to advocate for change through digital platforms. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work and community organizations. From volunteering at local soup kitchens and animal shelters to participating in environmental clean-up drives and mentoring programs, they are actively contributing to the well-being of their communities. Many schools and universities also encourage community service as part of their curriculum, fostering a sense of civic responsibility among students. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms. Young people may not always engage in traditional volunteer activities, but they contribute to their communities in other ways. For example, starting a local business, organizing community events, or simply being a good neighbor can all be considered forms of community service. These actions, while seemingly small, can have a significant impact on the lives of others. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about the lack of community involvement among young people, the reality is far more nuanced. Young people are actively engaged in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. By recognizing their diverse contributions, we can foster a more positive and collaborative relationship between generations.",
"The ubiquitous nature of advertising in our modern world leads many to believe that most advertisements exaggerate the benefits of products. While it is true that some advertisements employ hyperbole and misleading claims, it is an oversimplification to assert that all advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 

Firstly, it is important to recognize that advertising serves a crucial purpose: to inform consumers about available products and services. While some advertisements may focus on emotional appeals or subjective experiences, others provide factual information about product features, specifications, and benefits. For example, car advertisements often include detailed information about engine size, fuel efficiency, and safety features, which can be helpful for consumers making informed purchasing decisions.
Secondly, the effectiveness of advertising relies on consumer skepticism.
Consumers are generally aware that advertisements aim to persuade them, and they often approach them with a critical eye.
This skepticism serves as a natural filter, allowing consumers to discern between genuine product benefits and exaggerated claims.
For instance, a consumer considering a new smartphone might be skeptical of claims about its battery life or camera quality, and they might research independent reviews or compare specifications to make an informed decision.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may employ deceptive tactics, it is unfair to generalize that all advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
Advertising plays a vital role in informing consumers, and their inherent skepticism helps them to navigate the persuasive nature of advertising and make informed choices.
By recognizing the diverse nature of advertising and the critical role of consumer skepticism, we can avoid falling prey to misleading claims and make informed decisions about the products we purchase.",

And they can share these knowledges with his sun or other people.
He can teach someting.
It is so exiciting and enjoynable thing.
In the other hand, young people can not this sharing.
Because they are so young and they have not enogh knowledge to teach for another person.

 Finally, older people have shape of life.
It means they can find a answer;who am i and what is distnation of life.In yougtime, we alway search some ansewer; who i am or what should do in my life.

So they can not hurry in their life and they can enjoy his lest of life.

 All in all,Seeminglly , youg peple have lot of time and they can enjoy their life more, But , in fact, older people can more enjoy than young people.Because they have experience,knowledge and shape of life.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This exaggeration is achieved through a variety of techniques, including selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals.
Firstly, advertisements often present only the most positive aspects of a product, carefully omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might highlight its sleek design and advanced camera features, but fail to mention its short battery life or limited storage capacity. This selective information creates an idealized image of the product, leading consumers to believe it is superior to its competitors.
Secondly, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, they associate these positive emotions with the product being advertised. For example, a commercial for a luxury car might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that owning the car will bring similar joy and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the product's actual functionality and value.
Finally, advertisements often present unrealistic portrayals of products and their benefits. This is particularly evident in commercials for beauty products, where models with flawless skin and hair are used to suggest that the product can achieve similar results. In reality, these images are often heavily edited and do not reflect the true effects of the product. This unrealistic portrayal can lead consumers to unrealistic expectations and disappointment.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately represent products, the majority employ various techniques to create an exaggerated and idealized image. By selectively presenting information, appealing to emotions, and portraying unrealistic benefits, advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are. This manipulation can mislead consumers and lead to dissatisfaction with their purchases.",
"Young people stand for the future of one society. It is worthy of discussing what they do when they are free. Recently there are many reports of younth consumption of luxury purse and cosmetics in Taiwan. Young people are depicted as egocentric and indifferent to social conditions in such reports. Is it true that the youth nowadays are no longer embodiment of passion to change the world?

Examining carefully, there are many examples of enthusiastic young men to help their community. For instance, a group of sophomore and junior students in Yang Ming Medical College annually visit Yu Li Asylum to support therapists there. The prepartion begun at least one year earlier. These future doctors learn not only from textbooks but also from interacting with patients. They are not satistfied with a knowleage of disease and therapies; human beings are their ultimate concerns. 

Since some young people contribute their leisure to those who are in need, then where does the myth of aloof youth come from in Taiwan?  I think there might be some reasons behind the prejudice to young people. Nowadays young people are more daring to express their discontent to social realities than their parents did. But our society regards these opinions as pure complaint, a symbol of arrogance. This is the first mistake, 


Although some young people are busy indulging in various kinds of luxures, others are dedicated to improvement of where they live. It is not fair to deny the effort made by young people tip a tag of laziness.So I can't agree that young people nowadays don't give enough time for their community.",
"In my opinion older people enjoy life more than younger people do.I can count two reasons for this.
Firstly,a younger person does not care about time.He thinks that everything in his life will continue as before.But when he starts to get older,especially after thirty;he understands that the things are gradually changing.For instance a young man spends most of his time playing sports, going to clubs,watching films etc.After ten years the habits start to change. You start to make a program in which you can use your time efficiently.Instead of playing sports most of the time you just play 1 hour a day.Or instead of watching tv all night;you seperate this time into more parts and do many things in order to make it more enjoyable.
Moreover,perceiving enjoyment of life differs from person to person.From my point of view adding some value to humanity  is the prominent aim of my life.For instance when i used to be a freshman student,I always cared about passing the exams.I rarely to think about finding new things and contribute to science world.I thought that after graduating i would have much time to do research.But now I see that if i used my time efficiently and prepare myself to my goals it would have been better.So as time passes people realize that enjoying life is connected strictly to what you want to do in your life and whether you achived your goal or not.When you get older you will be targeted to your dreams closely.
In conclusion;when people get older;they understand the meaning of life and try to enjoy it more .It comes with maturity.",
"Thesedays, it is really tough to give time to help our communities. Most young people are busy to have fun by themselves or to get ready for their future. Did you have enough time to help your community? Let me tell you how young people's mind became evil.
	First, young people in Korea love to get drunk. I saw Korean Times last week, and it said ""More than 77 percents of Korean University students are near alcoholics"". I do not think the ""near alcoholics"" have the time to help their communities. 
	Second, other young people in Korea are really busy to get ready for their future. They try their best to get all kind of licenses like MBA, GPA. It is really hard to get a job in Korea nowadays. That is why young people get ready for their future.
	Third, young people hate to help their communities, because they think it is bored and not necceary. Their parants should tell them to help their communities.
	Last, it is really bad for their future if they do not give enough time to help their communities. It will make them to be phycos. If they are not used to be in communities, they will be selfish, mean, and evil. 
	I saw a person who helped his commnunity when he was young, he did almost perfect control with time. He never got drunk, got many licenses, helped his community. He is enjoying his life now. I am telling you that all young people should give enough time to help their communities.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertisements play a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods and services, I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of products, making them appear far superior to their actual capabilities. This essay will explore the reasons behind this phenomenon and provide specific examples to support my stance.
One of the primary reasons why advertisements often embellish the truth is to create a sense of desire and urgency in consumers. By highlighting the most appealing features of a product and downplaying its limitations, advertisers aim to evoke a sense of need and persuade viewers to make a purchase. For instance, a car commercial may showcase the vehicle's sleek design and powerful engine while conveniently omitting information about its fuel efficiency or potential safety concerns.
Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ persuasive language and imagery to manipulate consumer emotions. By associating products with positive emotions such as happiness, success, or love, advertisers create an emotional connection that can override rational decision-making. For example, a perfume commercial might feature a glamorous model in a romantic setting, suggesting that using the fragrance will enhance one's attractiveness and social standing.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may present an honest portrayal of products, the majority tend to exaggerate their qualities to create a compelling narrative that entices consumers. By employing persuasive techniques and focusing on the most appealing aspects, advertisers often create an idealized version of reality, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based on inflated expectations. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making any decisions.",
"Does having knowledge in all types of academic subjects is better than being an expert on only one single subject?Actually I both agree and disagree about it.Because both of them has advantages in some sort of areas.
	A person must always try to learn more and more in my opinion.Because it is a key to success.A person who is able to speak about every subject gets respect from people.Because by this he/she can prove himself to everyone in every field.For example in social life or in bussines.If a person has an idea and thoughts about every argument or debate he is in, he will just keep getting respect from people.I am not saying that a person must be a genius in every fields.He only has to gain some information to prove that he has thoughts to be considered by people.If you want to be taken serious by them you must gain respect and this is a way for it.
	But a person who is an expert on what he does as a job , gets respect in only his field.But this is not a disadvantage for the person because it is an aim which he should have.For example, a plactic surgeon who has mastered in his field, gets more patients.The patients who are satisfied by his work tells his name to their friends and this chain will go on and on.By this, the surgeon will have a good reputation.And this reputation he has will return him by more patients.And the surgeon will be successful in his main aim by working as a surgeon:making money for a living. 
	In my opinion a person must have knowledge in every areas of work,arts,academic subjects etc. to gain respect in social life.But he/she must has to be a master in his area which he does as a job if he wants to gain respect from community.",
"Some people said that young people enjoy life more than older people do , I think I agree this statement .
    There are many reason to support my opinion , first of all , since young people often own a younger and ""fresh"" heart , so in them eyes , everything are shining and intresting , they have many hopes so they want to try everything  in their younger time , by this way , thay could have more changse than old people , even through they could make some mistake , but those mistake still can became young people's valuble esperents ,like poeple said, there are always a thread by sunshine under the dark cloud ,the sunshine always comes and gose in a secound , to keep up hope is how can make the sunshine stay.  Secondly , young people were able to get more new ideas or messege than older people , thay brave to make more new way to sove problems  , by this way , they can enjoy the fresh feeling too, so it make young people enjoy the life . Moreover , whit the time going on , more and more involution comes into people' life , for instance , computer , internet , KTV and so on , those thing offere more changes to young people enjoy their life . Fanilly , besause older people had a full life , so maybe they fell tired , so they  want quite and pices rather than ""try"" ,  it is so different with young peolpe .    In one word , in my opinion , young people have more energe than older people to enjoy their life , and also young people's body are able to help them to finesh their hope , so I think young people enjoy life more than older people.",
"In the contemporary world, advertising plays a pervasive role in shaping consumer preferences and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of products, I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks, creating an idealized image that often deviates from reality. 

One compelling reason for this discrepancy lies in the inherent nature of advertising. Advertisers are primarily concerned with generating sales and maximizing profits. To achieve this objective, they employ a range of persuasive techniques, including exaggerated claims, selective information, and emotional appeals. For instance, a beauty product advertisement might showcase a flawless model with radiant skin, implying that using the product will guarantee similar results. However, the reality is that the model's appearance is often enhanced through makeup, lighting, and post-production editing, creating an unrealistic expectation for consumers. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently focus on highlighting the positive aspects of a product while strategically omitting or minimizing its shortcomings. A car advertisement might emphasize its sleek design, powerful engine, and advanced safety features, while downplaying its fuel efficiency or potential maintenance issues. This selective presentation can lead consumers to form an incomplete and potentially misleading perception of the product. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately portray the features of products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits and downplay their drawbacks. This deliberate manipulation of information aims to create a desirable image that entices consumers, often leading to unrealistic expectations and dissatisfaction. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be discerning and critical when evaluating advertisements, recognizing that they are often designed to sell rather than to provide an objective assessment of a product.",
"To be realistic i guess it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do.But that does not mean if u get older you can no longer enjoy life,but instead your ability to enjoy life decreases.
To be more specific your physical ability decreases as you get older putting u in more risk of getting sick thus spending more time at the hospital and seeing the doctor and i do not think any one enjoys that.Moreover young people are more fit than older people thus are preferable to do things old people can not do, like going skydiving going to places u have never been ther before like going to space, not having  to follow a certain diet in other words eat whatever you want,things old people can not do for health and physical reasons. More, young people in a society are allowed to go clubing, go on dates, flirt with the opposite sex, dress whatever you want....While as for an adult doing what i mentiond is bad for your image in the society....So by being an adult their are a lot of things you can not experience in life for different reasons.
But as i mentioned being an adult does not mean u can no longer enjoy life. you can still do in a different way for instance,as an adult you can enjoy life and have fun through spending time with your children and their children and by watching your child grow and raise him to become a successfull individual in the society he is living in,also by having a quite and peacful time enjoying a certain lovely view in nature such as watching the sun go down with your wife.
But in my opinion now the activities young people do allows you to enjoy life have a taste of it more than the activities you do as an adult well at least thats what i think now maybe in the future when i get old and live life as an aduld  i might change my mind but for now ill enjoy life in my way.",
"Some people beleive that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Others beleive that older people enjoy life more than young people. I beleve that young people enjoy life more than older people ,I have some points suggests  my opinion.

First, young people have healthier bodies than older people and this helps young people to reveal the world by traveling every year to a new country with a new adventures while older people do not have the ability to travel too much so they prefer staying at home.

Second, somebody may say that older people can do whatever they want  their sequence days  because they are retired from their works so they are not busy. But still young people beside working and getting  tired  they can go outside every day like shopping going restaurants enjoy playing many sports like tennis, soccer, and basketball . Young people's life is so interesting while the older people are so bored

Third, young people have the ability to read more and to reveal new  knowlege, while most of the older people must wear glasses and sometimes they get confused to read the words and to see them clear. Also the older people are more angry and nervous while the young people are not.

Sadly, every individual will grow and rise till the death, I mean that the young people will reach the level of eldness , so I advise the young people to enjoy their life before getting older.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a complex one. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When exposed to diverse subjects, individuals develop the ability to connect ideas, analyze information from multiple perspectives, and generate creative solutions. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the social and economic factors that shaped historical events. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base promotes adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, skills are constantly evolving, and individuals with specialized knowledge may find themselves limited in their career options. Conversely, those with a broad understanding of various fields are better equipped to adapt to new challenges and pursue diverse opportunities. For example, a person with a background in both science and humanities might be able to transition seamlessly between research and communication roles. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches our lives and fosters a sense of interconnectedness. By exploring different subjects, we gain a deeper appreciation for the world around us and the diverse perspectives that shape our understanding. This intellectual curiosity allows us to engage in meaningful conversations, appreciate different cultures, and contribute to a more informed and tolerant society. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters critical thinking, promotes adaptability, and enriches our lives. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, we equip ourselves with the tools necessary to navigate a complex world and contribute to a more informed and interconnected society.",
"It can be read every day in the newspaper, local facilities like the youth center or the sports club have to be closed. This mostly has two reasons: firstly, the decline in budged and secondly the problems in finding staff willing to work for fee. In my opinion, young people should contribute more to their communities.

First of all, I believe that young people being member of a community activity like the local soccer club or the youth center has many advantages in their personnal development. And if an active soccer player or youth  group attender is enthusiastic about his activity, he or she will one day take over responsibility and lead the group. In that way, the person gives back what he receives from the community

Additionally, community service is getting more important as the average age in a community gets older. Older people need a strong community and young people contributing to it. Young people should do more to make life more enjoyable for old people.

In other countries like China or Russia, there is a strong focus on the community. Everyone contributs to the community and also gets something out of it. It is like one hand washing the other. For instance a family in China would help to paint the city hall in order to create a value for the community. Western countries should take thes less developed countries as an good example how community live can be.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should introduce a system to encourage young people to help their communities. It has to be mor attractive to do social work. For instance, I could imagine a system by which young people receive credit points for social activities they have done. These credit points can be used to get a discount from tuitio fees at university or to receive free membership of the local soccer team.",
"Its true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.It is the marketing skills of the companies in making profits.

Most of the advertisements are so well designed and presented that they attract large part of audience.People tend to buy those products.When it comes to reality the product does'nt seem better.For example,  women tend to buy various kinds of cosmetics with out actually knowing how well they suit them.


So customer should be very discerning in purchasing products.Its better not to be simply carried away by advertisements rather check the statistics of the product before purchasing. Consulting and taking others'(who might have already used the product) opinion  would help to purchase better products.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various initiatives. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-up drives to supporting local charities, they are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change activism showcases their dedication to environmental sustainability. Organizations like Fridays for Future, led by Greta Thunberg, have mobilized young people worldwide to advocate for climate action, demonstrating their commitment to a better future. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to make a difference. Many are using their technological expertise to create innovative solutions for community problems. For example, young programmers are developing apps that connect volunteers with local organizations, facilitating efficient community engagement. This demonstrates their ability to leverage their skills to address real-world challenges. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people's involvement in community service, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute. From volunteering their time to utilizing their skills, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact on their communities. Their dedication and innovative approaches are shaping a brighter future for all.",
"I partially agree with the statement because I believe that it depends on the personal values and morals of the person in cause. This opinion not only deals with young people but also with older people. There are some young people who have a great intrest in the well being of tehir communities and therefore do ther best to improve and make it advance to a better level. These young people have certain strong principles that they strongly believe in, taught at home from their parens or at school. While there are others that can see clearly how their communities are degrading and do nothing at all about it. These people have different ideaologies than the people that do all that is in their hands to improve the communities. How do we expect these young ones to do anything for their communties if they blame them of their disgraces.Violence, corruption, sexual abuse, racsim all these are factors that affect young peoples actions and opinions on their communities. If older people where to set themselves as examples the young people that are being accused of doing nothing for their communities would react, but no older people are more busy corrupting and degrading the communities. The young people that try their best to improve these communities are those that have strong faith and are very opptomistic. They have the will to undertake new projects to improve the community situations, while others have simply given up on humanity as a whole and simply try to live with their communities; and their defects. Overall it is a question of hope, principals, and faith in teh idea that things can change to better if we try to change these things.",
"I agree with the statement that most advertisenments make products seem much better that they really are but not always. Media nowdays plays a big role in making correct decisions. 
	Advertisements are used to promote selling of products so that the company can have profits. It is never for the sake of one's good. Companies care for their profits and loss and that's the reason why laws have been enforced for making advertisements to protect privacy of people and filter the content of the advertisement.
	Insurances are to protect people not to show their lifestyle or something. By saying that what I mean is the better insurance that you get people think that the better off you are. By better insurance I mean the reputed one or the one that has a lot of media influence. For ex, I see an advertisement for Geico Car Insurance almost everyday on the T.V. trying to get more customers by saying that their prices are lower, but what it turns out to be is that they reduce prices in one place but make up for that and profits in another section. 
	It is basically tricking people. Like if you don't you well on a certain part of the test you try to make up for it in the other section but it doesn't help because it affects your grade anyways.
	Advertisements are not always like that they sometimes they are made in favor of the well being of the people. For ex. There is ad which asks parents to be friendly with their teenage children and talk to them about not going on the wrong way like becoming alcoholic or smoking. I think that ads like that are not bad and they just help reduce generation gaps in my views.
	In conclusion, it depens on the type of the ad wheter it is trying to make the product seem much better or not. But most of times the statement is unfortunately true.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media activism, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and driving real change. For example, the recent surge in youth-led climate change protests, amplified by social media, has put pressure on governments and corporations to address environmental concerns. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work, often focusing on areas that resonate with their interests and skills. From mentoring underprivileged children to organizing food drives and cleaning up local parks, they contribute their time and energy to address pressing social issues. Many schools and universities also encourage community service, providing opportunities for students to gain valuable experience and make a difference in their communities. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms. Young people may not always engage in traditional volunteer activities, but their contributions can be equally valuable. For instance, starting a local business that creates jobs, advocating for social justice through art or music, or simply being a good neighbor and offering support to those in need are all forms of community service. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to focus on the perceived lack of engagement among some young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse and impactful ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteer work and beyond, young people are actively shaping a better future for themselves and their communities.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's horizons is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters a well-rounded individual with a greater capacity for critical thinking, adaptability, and problem-solving. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts from different disciplines. For example, a historian with an understanding of economics can better analyze the impact of trade on historical events. Similarly, a scientist with a background in philosophy can critically evaluate the ethical implications of their research. This interdisciplinary approach leads to a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues and fosters innovative solutions. 

Furthermore, a broad education equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's rapidly evolving world, specialized skills can quickly become obsolete. However, a strong foundation in diverse subjects provides a flexible skillset that can be applied to various fields. For instance, a student with a broad background in humanities and sciences can transition seamlessly between careers in research, education, or even entrepreneurship. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base promotes critical thinking and intellectual curiosity. By exploring different perspectives and engaging with diverse ideas, individuals develop the ability to analyze information objectively, question assumptions, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking skill is essential for navigating the complexities of modern life and making informed decisions. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more enriching and adaptable approach to learning. It fosters interdisciplinary thinking, promotes adaptability, and cultivates critical thinking skills, ultimately leading to a more well-rounded and successful individual.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them seem far superior to their actual capabilities. 

One compelling reason for this exaggeration is the inherent nature of advertising itself. The primary goal of advertising is to persuade consumers to buy a product, and this often involves employing persuasive techniques that can distort reality. For instance, commercials frequently use unrealistic scenarios, such as showcasing a cleaning product effortlessly removing stubborn stains, when in reality, the product may require multiple applications to achieve the desired result. Similarly, beauty products are often advertised with models who have undergone extensive makeup and photo editing, creating an unrealistic standard of beauty that can mislead consumers. 

Furthermore, the use of celebrity endorsements and emotional appeals further contributes to the exaggeration of product benefits. Consumers are often swayed by the allure of a famous personality promoting a product, even if they have no genuine knowledge or experience with it. Emotional appeals, such as evoking feelings of happiness, confidence, or success, can also create a false sense of fulfillment associated with a product. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may present accurate information, the majority tend to embellish the qualities of products to create a more appealing image. The inherent nature of advertising, coupled with the use of persuasive techniques and emotional appeals, often leads to an exaggerated portrayal of products, leaving consumers with unrealistic expectations and potentially disappointing experiences.",
"Nowadays, many people believe that young people are very selfish and they don't do anything for their community.
But, I disagree with this kind of opinion. 
From long time ago, people have complaint about younger than them.
However, nowadays youger people volunteer in many fields for their community and they study very hard.

 First of all, we can find many young students to volunteer in many place.
Of couse, some school need some volunteer job for their credit.
Even though,  there are many students to do it just for helping their community.
For example, we can see many young poeple to voluteer in the orphanage or hospital or school.
They can be very helpful in this kind of place.
Because,in the hospital or orphanage house , there many peoples to desire the help.
But the supply is very lack compare to  the demand.
The young people compensate the gap.
How appreciatable thing it is.

 Futhermore, many young people study hard and work for thier future and their community 
Actually healthy minded young people can be very important resorces for their community.
They take responsible the future of their society and the results, it can the most helpful thing for society.
For example, if young people reglect their duty in the society, it can be very miserable thing for the community.
Because they are our future by themselves.
Fortunetly, most young people take their responsibility, it can naturally predict the positive future.

 To sum up, many students give enough time to helping their society by voluteering and studying or working.
As I considered, our communitie's future is very bright because of appreciatable young people.
I think that we should encourage the healthy-minded young people to go on the positive way not to blame them.",
"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Young people tend to be innocent and naive to their surrounding world, and thus can enjoy life without worrying about the future. Older people know how the world works; they have bigger reponsabilities than can affect the world more, thus they have to keep worrying about the consequences of their actions and cannot enjoy life at its full potentail.
Young people, including children and teenagers, are being introduced to their world. The learning process is like a enjoyable journey about the meaning of life. Their innocence prevents them from thinking beyond the future and thus they enjoy life without thinking about the consequences of their actions. They tend to be more liberal when making desicions; they want to try everything that is ahead in their lives. This form of thinking allows them to enjoy life with liberty. An example that best illustrates the liberty of young generations is the free expression of love on the 70's embodied by the 'Hippies'.
Older people tend to think differently than young people. They think more about the future and and emotional stability. They are experienced and know the dangers and benefits of their surrounding environment. They tend to be more conservative when making decisions and always have to speculate about the outcomes of their choices in life. Thus they more reluctant to try all the different tastes that life can bring, because they can judge the future consequences of their actions.
In conclusion, I agree that young people can enjoy life more than old people; because young people are naive and can wonder through life without thinking about the consequences of their actions, while older people have bigger responsabilities that prevents them from acting freely.",
"When a young men grows helping other people, he will do the same thing during the adulthood. It is an important thing that consent to value how a person is good or bad.
In modern society is truly difficult to find a young with a non-selfish attitude. But the problem does not depends from the young, but depends by the way his parents have educaded him.
This is a big problem that in the future will carry us in a much more egoistic society.
If a father doesn't play often with his child, if he gives only money to his boy, He doesn't teach anything to his boy, and the boy will grow up without a guide. The boy will grow only with the importance of material thing, not human values.
Instead if parents take care about her child's education, and show him how to live with simple things, with real human values, and showing how they help their communities, probably the child will do the same thing in the future.
So we have to give a better education to our child, with more simple and human value, not material. 
Only proceding in this way we will have a better society.",

Different companies uses advertise products in different ways some of which may seem illecit, subliminal messages, but the purpose of advertisements is not always to illustrate the quality of a product, but it's importance in our daily life.
It is in the companies greatest interest to glorify their products, but it is also in their interest to make sure that the product actually works.
It is obvious that an advertised product will work better then the actual product because there are factors affecting the product that may cause malfunctionings.The way an advertise is made, the components of the product and the users cautiond about the product will give different results on the functioning of the product.
Advertisements are done in many ways: writing, visually, subcontiously, and on a auditory level. Visual advertisements are presented to us by video and fotografical commercials in which the product is in its best conditions, it is new and a times is presented as a digital object something unreal, basically a drawing. Advertising through wtiring may be risky in that the opinions may differ. On a subconsciouse level we will accept the commercial itself and find it great so it is us that find advertisements better than the product.
Again the conditions of a product on an advertisement are perfect while one might find malfunctions in the product as it may have been dameged by time, transport and our misuse of it. All components of the product are key factors in the functioning of the product a new product will always be better than an old one.
Man error is a major cause in one agreement in the statement. What our brain makes us believe may differ what we experience and believe.
Concluding, it is not the advertisement that makes product look better but it our way of thinking that prevents us from seeing the true reasons why advertised products are better than owned products.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess an abundance of energy and a sense of boundless possibility, the statement fails to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of happiness and the evolving perspectives that come with age. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and uncertainties. The pursuit of education, career choices, and financial stability can create a constant sense of stress and anxiety. This pressure can overshadow the enjoyment of everyday experiences. Conversely, older individuals have often achieved a degree of stability and security, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. For example, a retired teacher may find immense joy in traveling the world or pursuing hobbies they never had time for during their working years.

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment evolves with age. Young people may prioritize immediate gratification and fleeting pleasures, such as social gatherings or technological entertainment. However, older individuals often find fulfillment in deeper, more meaningful experiences, such as family connections, community involvement, and personal growth.
A grandparent, for instance, may derive immense joy from spending time with their grandchildren and witnessing their development.

In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain carefree spirit, it is inaccurate to claim that they enjoy life more than older people.
The experience of joy is subjective and multifaceted, and it evolves throughout life.
Older individuals have the advantage of accumulated wisdom, stability, and a deeper understanding of what truly brings happiness.
Therefore, it is more accurate to say that both young and old can find fulfillment and enjoyment in their respective stages of life.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, both young and old individuals can find fulfillment and happiness in different stages of life. 

Firstly, young people often face a unique set of pressures that can detract from their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be stressful and demanding. Moreover, the social expectations and pressures of youth, such as fitting in and achieving success, can create a sense of anxiety and insecurity. In contrast, older individuals may have already achieved a degree of stability and financial security, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves over time. What brings joy to a young person, such as exploring new experiences and pursuing romantic relationships, may hold less appeal to an older individual who has already lived through those phases. Older people may find greater satisfaction in nurturing relationships, contributing to their communities, and reflecting on their life experiences. 

Finally, it is important to recognize that happiness is not solely determined by age. Individuals of all ages can experience joy, contentment, and fulfillment. The key lies in finding meaning and purpose in life, regardless of one's stage. For example, a young entrepreneur may find immense satisfaction in building a successful business, while an elderly volunteer may derive immense joy from helping others. 

In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification. While youth may offer certain advantages, it is not a guarantee of greater enjoyment. Both young and old individuals can find happiness and fulfillment in different ways, and the key to a fulfilling life lies in finding meaning and purpose at any age.",
"In the realm of academic pursuits, the age-old debate between breadth and depth of knowledge continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers profound expertise in a particular field, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This essay will explore the advantages of a diverse intellectual foundation, arguing that it fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with greater adaptability in a rapidly changing world. Specialization, while valuable, can sometimes limit one's ability to navigate unfamiliar territories. By having a grasp of various disciplines, individuals can readily apply their knowledge and skills to new challenges, making them more versatile and resourceful in diverse situations. For instance, a student with a broad knowledge of history, economics, and political science might be better equipped to analyze and understand current events than someone solely focused on a specific subject.
Furthermore, a diverse intellectual foundation promotes critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. By exposing oneself to different perspectives and methodologies, one develops the capacity to analyze information from multiple angles, identify underlying patterns, and arrive at more comprehensive solutions. For example, a student who has studied both literature and science might be able to approach a complex ethical dilemma with a more nuanced understanding, drawing upon insights from both disciplines.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a distinct advantage. It fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse intellectual foundation, individuals can navigate the complexities of our time with greater agility and insight, ultimately enriching their lives and contributing meaningfully to society.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives addressing social issues. From organizing environmental cleanups to advocating for social justice, young people are using their energy and creativity to make a positive impact. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their commitment to creating a better future.

Furthermore, many young people dedicate their time to volunteering in various organizations. They contribute to local charities, mentor underprivileged children, and assist in disaster relief efforts. These acts of service demonstrate a genuine desire to help others and make a difference in their communities.

While it's important to acknowledge the challenges faced by young people, such as academic pressures and financial constraints, it's equally crucial to recognize their dedication to community service. Their contributions, both large and small, are shaping a more compassionate and engaged society. Therefore, it's unfair to paint all young people with the same brush and dismiss their efforts to make a positive impact.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming that they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of “enjoyment” is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, such as pursuing new experiences and social connections, may not hold the same appeal for an older individual who values stability and meaningful relationships.
For example, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive more pleasure from spending time with their family and grandchildren.

Secondly, the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood can also contribute to a sense of fulfillment and purpose.
Older individuals often have a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world, which can lead to a more profound appreciation for life.
They may find joy in mentoring younger generations, pursuing their passions, or simply enjoying the fruits of their labor.
In conclusion, while youth may have a certain carefree energy, it is unfair to assume that they inherently enjoy life more than older people.
Both stages of life offer unique opportunities for joy and fulfillment, and the experience of living a full life can bring its own rewards, regardless of age.
Ultimately, happiness is a personal journey that evolves throughout our lives, and it is impossible to definitively declare one age group inherently happier than another.",
"Every stage of live has its own priority and ways to enjoy the moment. I do think that young people and older people can both enjoy the life they are living. 
However the intesity with which someone can enjoy live mainly depends on the efforts and the sacrifices he had to do to reach to that point. In fact we can take the exemple of a young boy: his live, his universe is quite simple. A single simple thing can fulfill him like the consideration of his teacher when he has drown a beautifull tree or learnt a poetry. But I think to enjoy that moment of proudness he had to concentrate and to make an effort.
On the contrary, I am sure that some student who doesn't really work hard to succeed in his studies and who thinks that what he is doing is just enough to pass his exam can't really enjoy live. In fact even if he has all the time and the possibilities to go on hollidays and to party with his mates, he would soon or later fill that he is not doing his best and won't enjoy this live anymore. That's why I am depply convinced that in order to enjoy live, we have to see in our past and be proud of what we have been able to perform.
Moreover, after years of work in a very fullfiled career, older people have earned money that can allow them to travel, to have the live they have always dreamed of. But they have earn more than money during their career: they have earned the ability to be sincirely proud of what they have done. That is to say, the familly they have built, the education they have given to their child and the good memories they are giving to their grand-children. That is why I think that older people can enjoy live more than younger ones.",
"I agree with the statement about having broad knowledge of many different subjects is better than only one specific subject. Nowadays, there are too much knowledge to learn. Everyday we can get new information from the internet, books, newspapers, and TVs.
  First, I think every subject is important to us. Some people thinks that only high-technology is the most important thing of our society. Because of the great improve of technology we have a convient live. But it doesn't mean other subjects worth nothing. Good society needs good policy and it relates to many many different subjects like economy, history and so on.
  Second, since we can get so much information everyday, we should tell which is right and which is wrong, which is trouth and which is fake. In order for us to tell from right to wrong we should have some basic knowledge. We should have broad basic knowledge of different kinds of field.
  Third, even when talking about high-tech we should learn knowledge from many different kinds of field and combine it together. Only if we combine different kinds of knowledge can we turn our technique into application. Many new industry combine two or even more fields. Bio and electronics, Bio and MEMs, Bio and nanotechnology are all the new trend in the future.

"Recently, it is said that the younger do not provide adequite time to help their communities due to the change of the social structure. There are two prominent factors: the lack of building the relationships with others and the increace of the hours for study and work.
   First,  due to the development of the IT industry, people have losed the opptunities to meet  and communicate with people directly and  result in  becoming devoid of the ability to connect with people. People becom to reluctant to work to people positively.  Moreover, people expect to accomplish the deal by phones or internets without seeing each other.
  Second,  belonging to decreace of the birth rate and  the tendency that peole come to work and study for longer time compared to former time, people can not spend a long time to cooperate the communities. People are occupied to work for a long time, even in weekend and also in Asia countries, especailly, students are comped to study harder to enrol the best university. That removes the chance to work for their communities.
  Finally, the innovation of the IT industry change the society disadvantageously. People no longer can understand  the communities and deepen the relationships with them. If young people dedicate thier more time for thier communities, people will be more abunduant throghtout communication.",
"To enjoy life is the aim of the majority of people. Everybody wants to be happy and not to be closed on one's problems, but it is quite difficult to be unaware of misery and all the plagues the world coneys. One's people life is so precious that everybody is looking for a fullfilled one and therefore there is no age to enjoy life. 
Obviously there are differencies between the way of enjoying it for young people and old ones.

First of all, young people are defined by being non-experienced and so it appears as an evidence that they want to live their lives fully; they are generally opened on everything and interested in all what they see. Young people are insatiable. Moreover they have the priviledges of youth and they are allowed to have fun in different ways than old people. Being aware of their fate, young people try to do whatever they want to in order not to have the impression of having spoilt their strenght's age. To enjoy life is not a schedule or a precise thing so everyone trying to do it in one's own way.
It depends on what we are keen on doing or for example it can be determinated by the money we have. To that point of view, older people who are generally richer than young people are able to enjoy their  lives thanks to the wealth. But wealth is not a warantee for being happy, especially when it does not sound with health.
 We might say that each of us enjoy life in a different way but there is no ageing consideration in happiness and for example a philosophy like the hedonism is one way to reach it and to ejoy life at every ages",
"Nowadays, there are lots of companies working on same products that causes competition. In order to gain more money even they are not good, they are trying to sell their products by making good advertisements. Products can seem much better because of technological equipments that are used in making advertisements, quality of people used in it and psicologicalosophica effects on people.

The first reason that we can see the product much more better is technology. For instance, when  you see a face cream advertisement in TV, smooth faces effect people especially women, However , smooth faces are just the results of computer skills. Without thinking about this game, people can buy that product in order to make their face look like the women in advertisement. However, they cannot reach that goal. 

Good looking people that are used in advertisements is the other reason that products seem much better. For instance, some clothing advertisements effects people by good looking men or women. The clothes are look great on them.

The another reason may be philosophical. Showing good features of life in advertisements are very smart idea to effect the people. For example, one of the water advertisement in my country is about showing happy and healthy baby with her mother drinking that water and seems very effective. I think this kind of scenes in an advertisement are very significant to change the people's mind to buy their product.  

To sum up, I strongly believed that the products are not as good as they seem in the advertisements. The behaviors of company owners are normal because they are trying to sell their products. Thus, we should just know the fake of this illustrations and buy the products that we trust.",
"I agree to the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities for three reasons;  too busy to participate, priority in helping their communities is very low, and fact that existence of community itself is questionable. 
 First, the young people do not devote their time for helping their communities becase they are simply too busy.  There are things they need to do in order for their dream to come true.  For example, I put in a time in my acadmic work in order to achieve enough grade to be accepted to the University I wished for. On top of this, I participated in three different sports team, so that the Universities knew that I was an active member of school. And on top of this, I had attended to the SAT prep course to maximize my score.  I just didn't have time to spend time in the community volunteer.
 Secondly, the young people's priorities are usually in different direction, so that they don't even pay attention in helping their communities.  I sure was not a kind of teenager to give up my time to help communitity instead of going out with a girl who I liked.  The range for the definition ""young people"" is some what ambiguous, but its very likely that people in their teenage choose their private and personal life over helping their community.  The reason is very simple; they like private life better and feel excitment.  
 Lastly, the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, because young people can't find the community itself.  It's not just young people, who can't find community, I believe people nowadays do not rely on community at all, that their existance might have been forgotten.  Especially in the city life, it's possible for someone to not to interact with anyone or anything to retain your lifestyle.",
"The issue of advertisements may be considered in different ways. It is often believed that the purpose of advertisements is only to make people aware of the existence of the product. However it is also true that, in some cases, advertisements make products seem much beautiful or much useful than they are. Taking all aspects into account, I strongly feel that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

   The first reason for my belief is that advertisements always show products in a beautiful environment with people who seems very happy, who do not have daily life problems... I think that this fake representation of life make people want their life to look like advertisements and to achieve it ... they have to buy this new product if they want to have a better life.

   Another way to justify my point of view is that making products seem much better than they really are is consubstancial to the purpose of advertisements. Indeed, the aim is to make people think that they MUST buy this product, as a result advertisements have to convince people that this one is better than all the other one. 

   Last but not least, I am firmly convinced that the aim of advertisements is not only to make products seem much better than they really are, it is also to brainwash people in order to make them interested only by material things.

All things considered, I would finish by saying that, in my opinion, the result of advertisements are that people just want to buy more and more things in order to lead a more happy life like people they can see in adds but, actually the fact that they have more and more desire make them more unhappy.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and fostering collective action. For instance, the recent surge in online activism surrounding environmental issues demonstrates the power of young people to advocate for change through digital platforms. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work, often focusing on areas that resonate with their interests and skills. From mentoring underprivileged children to organizing environmental clean-up drives, they are actively contributing to the well-being of their communities. Many schools and universities also encourage community service as part of their curriculum, fostering a sense of civic responsibility among students. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms. Young people may not always engage in traditional volunteer activities, but their contributions can be equally valuable. For example, starting a local business that creates jobs or advocating for policies that benefit their community are forms of service that require dedication and commitment. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people's involvement in community service, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, young people are actively shaping their communities and making a positive impact. By recognizing and appreciating their efforts, we can foster a culture of civic engagement and empower them to continue making a difference.",
"If always watching the TV, you must see many different kind of advertisement. But most of them are not that true. I have heard someone said most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, I totally agree this statement, here is some examples for me to support this statement is correct.

      All producers must want consumers choose their products while consumers are comparing the product towards other substitutes. That is the main point why advertisement should make products seem much better than they are. In fact, their aim is to earn money.

      For example, substitutes like fast food shops McDonald and Burger King, Papa Johns and Pizza Hut and so on. Even films or TV shows, they still only promote the best and the most excited part to audiences. Indeed, that is normal but this is the main point that they did make the products seem much better.

      I had an experience about a film. watching the advertisement about a horror film through TV, the film was really exciting and the plot seems really attractive and scary, and so i paid and watched the film in a theatre. However, that is an undoubtedlly bored movie I have seen. The most frightened and excited you could all know from the TV. The advertisement really make the product so nice.

     Another bad experince is i read a advertisement through magazine which is about a hotel. The pictures inside were so grand and the food or rooms are nice. But, when i finally arrived there, i found that the rooms were dirty and those food are aweful. Then i complained to the manager, but his attitute was bad and arrogant. The result I had received which is far away form that advertisement which shown in magazine. I was extremely disappointed with that advertisement which make their product seem better.

     In conclusion, actually the advertisements are not 100 percent true, we should pay attention when we decide to buy it or not, and do not just believe the advisetisment. Therefore, as i said i totally agree with that statement which is totally correct.",
"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The inmature attitude and the strong ability to get involved in activities make the  young people beable to enjoy life more.

The young people are often willing to do some new things to make the life more interesting, while the older people are oftne afraid to try things that are unfamiliar to them. For example, young people like to wear fashionable cloths and drive fancy cars which are really cool for them. On the other side, older people such as my parents who are much more conservative. They often consider those cool things inmature and inappropriate. They always tell me not to buy those weird cloths away and spend more time on my school work. Wearing those cloths makes me feel special and I can compare them with my friends. However, there are few older people wearing cloths like teenagers.

Also, young people are able to do some excited activities that older people are afraid or not able to participate because their body conditions are not as well as young people. For example, I consider skiing the most excited and enjoyable sport in my life. It is fast and it does not hurt much when I fall into the snow. However, everytime when I invite my dad to join my friends and I to have a skiing trip, he refuses because he does not know how to ski at all. Although I try to convince him that it is easy to learn, he is still afraid to try.

In conclusion, young people are willing to try new things and participate in some excited activities which older people are not able to do because they are old and have different attitude from young people.",
"In recent years, the education systems are diffrent. Some people perfer the students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, however other perfer to have specialize in one specific subject. For me, i would agree with first oppinion. The reasons are as follows.
   First and formost reason is that in this sociaty we need compehensive person. Nowadays, the competition  is very drastic, every body has ambition to be the first, if i just have specialize in one specific subject, i could not allow to have various job oppotunities, and also i will lose some good chance.for example, if i specialize in history, i just can find some job rely on history, but there are not have many job in history, but if i study borad subjects i can afford many diffrent jobs, even it not intrested, but i can get job and money. I can servive. 
   Second factor is that it can improve my organizetion skills. for example, if i stduy broad knowledge of many academic sujects i will organize the time, and my work ethic. Also it enlarge my view, also in diffrent calsses, i will meet diffrent people, it also can improve my communication skills and interpersonal skills.
   Thid lies in fact is that it pave my way for furture. If i have abroad knowledge of many academic subjects, i can have good job oppotunity and also if i meet diffrent people, i can easy to talk with them and easy to find intrest objects to talk, because i have large knowledge.Also it improve my socal communication.
   In brief, even specialize in one specific subject, you might save time and save money, but you will loss more.According to what i have disscuss about, if you want to give them good impression and if you want to survive in this sociaty, you should have broad knowledge if many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject. Weighing the pros and cons of these argumentation, i agree that it is better to habe broad knowledge of many academic subject.",
"Now a days the technology has been improved to enjoy both yong and old equally .as the culture is getting changed ,if the old people go with the change  they mey also enjoy as youth.enjoyment comes from take the growth as benefits then taking it as useless
             The young people are enjoying more,as all the  helpful in present day  busy life.for example eating at fastfood centers then by cooking at home this makes them to use the time.the advanced improvement in computer decreses the work stress on them,as the salaries are more they are spending more money to get enjoy like buying sports cars and leading a luxurious life.

The people who are old enough are not satisfied with the the change in culture,they give  more importance to the moral values,health,andtheir own views.if they doesn't change their ideas they may not enjoy.
              for example consider the new year itself,the young people enjoy themselves in the parties and want to celebrate  the whole day with many people in clubs,the old people may not go the clubs and gets involved in the party.they sit idle at homes.the movies now a days  more concentrate on the youth and making them more enjoying,while the can't see those movies which involve romance,action e.t.c.

"A lot of people specialize themseves in one specific subject at university and take corses in the same department in order to have degrees in a particular field. We can wonder if it is good to have a specialized knowledge or a broad one.
	Having a specialized knowledge on an academic subject could be great if it is in the view of being a researcher, a specialist or a technician in a certain field. Moreover, it is easier to concentrate on one specific subject during studies and it is easier being more known because specialist of some subject are rare. For example, it is rare to find a specialist in treatments water process and so some people who are could have more chances to find a job after graduation.
	To the opposite, having an overview of sciences and some knowledge about religions and phylosophy is necessary in  every day life and also because some fields could cross others. For example, taking course about both politics and economics is better to understand the way a country goes. It is also very important to discover things in order to know what it seems to be the more interesting and which correspond the most to a personnality.
	According to me, the best is to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects at the beginning of the scholarship and to specialize at the end. It is like that the American universities work and I think it is better than in France because people are too specialized. In United States students must have credits from others departments they are studying in in order to have an awarness and a culture more important and so they can compare and choose a field in which they are interested in in order to specialize themselves after.",
"The ubiquitous nature of advertising in modern society leads many to believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products. While it is true that some advertisements employ deceptive tactics to entice consumers, it is an oversimplification to claim that all advertisements present a distorted reality. 

Firstly, the purpose of advertising is to persuade consumers to purchase a product or service. To achieve this goal, advertisers often highlight the positive aspects of their offerings, emphasizing features and benefits that may not be readily apparent to the average consumer. This does not necessarily equate to deception, but rather a strategic presentation of information. For example, a car advertisement might focus on the vehicle's fuel efficiency and safety features, while downplaying its potential drawbacks, such as limited cargo space.
However, it is important to acknowledge that some advertisements do engage in outright deception. This can involve making false claims about a product's effectiveness, using misleading imagery, or employing manipulative language. For instance, a weight loss product might advertise rapid and effortless weight loss, when in reality, such results are highly unlikely and often require significant lifestyle changes.
In conclusion, while it is true that some advertisements present a distorted view of reality, it is inaccurate to generalize that all advertisements do so. The vast majority of advertisements aim to persuade consumers by highlighting the positive aspects of a product, but they do not necessarily resort to deception. It is crucial for consumers to be discerning and critical when evaluating advertising messages, recognizing that they are often designed to appeal to our desires and aspirations. By doing so, we can make informed decisions about the products and services we choose to purchase.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to capture the diverse realities of youth engagement. While it is true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits over communal involvement, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to making a positive impact on their communities. 

One compelling example of young people's commitment to community service is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local food drives and environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice issues, young people are actively addressing pressing problems in their communities. These initiatives demonstrate a genuine desire to contribute to the common good and often leverage technology and social media to amplify their impact.
Furthermore, many young people are involved in traditional community service organizations, such as volunteer fire departments, youth groups, and religious organizations. These platforms provide opportunities for young individuals to learn valuable skills, develop leadership qualities, and connect with their communities in meaningful ways. Their contributions, though often less visible, are nonetheless crucial to the well-being of their communities.
In conclusion, while it is tempting to paint a picture of young people as apathetic and self-centered, the reality is far more nuanced. Countless young individuals are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating their commitment to making a positive difference in the world. By recognizing and celebrating these efforts, we can foster a culture of civic engagement that empowers young people to become active and responsible members of their communities.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it's better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having broad knowledge across various academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters a well-rounded understanding of the world and equips individuals with valuable skills for navigating complex challenges. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts from different disciplines. For instance, a history student with a grasp of economics can better understand the rise and fall of civilizations, recognizing the interplay of political, social, and economic factors. This cross-disciplinary perspective provides a richer understanding of complex issues and facilitates innovative solutions. 

Secondly, broad knowledge enhances critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Exposure to diverse subjects develops the ability to analyze information from different angles, identify patterns, and draw informed conclusions. This skillset is crucial in today's rapidly changing world, where individuals are constantly faced with new challenges and unexpected situations. 

Finally, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience. In a world where careers are constantly evolving, individuals with broad knowledge are better equipped to adapt to new demands and explore diverse opportunities. They are more likely to find fulfillment and success in a dynamic and interconnected world. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is more valuable in today's complex world. It fosters cross-disciplinary understanding, enhances critical thinking, and promotes adaptability, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful life.",

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives tackling social issues. From organizing environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice, young people are actively using their voices and skills to create positive change. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, demonstrates their willingness to challenge the status quo and fight for a better future.

Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time at local organizations, such as soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and hospitals. These acts of service not only benefit the community but also foster a sense of empathy and responsibility in young individuals. By engaging in hands-on work, they gain valuable experience and develop a deeper understanding of the needs of their community.
In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about the behavior of an entire generation, it's important to recognize the vast array of ways in which young people contribute to their communities. From activism to volunteering, they are actively shaping a better future and demonstrating their commitment to making a difference. To judge them solely on the basis of perceived inactivity is to overlook the countless examples of their dedication and service.",
"Today's youth is a busy and stressed one. Too busy to interact with their communities and their surroundings. Young people have responsibility such as school and afterschool activities as well as the desire to have a social life. It is because of these elements that I agree that young people nowadays to not give enough time to helping their communities.

As a highschool 12th grader, I must admitt that the mayority of people my age to not have time to help their communities. School is a hectic responsability and homework is increased throughout the year. When I have time off, I need to work on future homework assignments or on organizing my time for the other responsabilities that I have prioritized as more important than my community.

Another element in young peoples lives that takes away from helping the community, is afterschool activities. As an avarage highschool student, I take swimming classes afterschool or help the student council set up school events. If i am not working for the school or for my physical being, than i am in town practising for my SATs. I spend most of my weekdays worrying about my grades and my reponsabilities as a grade representative, than wondering what i could do to help the community.

Once school and afterschool events are over, I use my weekends to relax and go out with my friends. Young people nowadays don't really care about the community and rather worry about their own problems. If you ask young people what they find most important you will realize that their answer is selfish, in that it only thinks about themselves, because they only have time to worry about themselves.

In conclusion, young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities out but, it is only because we lack the time to do something about it. If our lives were more organized and less occuppied, perhaps an interest in helping our communities would surface.",
"Because I have only been young so far, I am convinced that young people seem to enjoy life in more depth that the adults or the grandparents do. 
I believe that when we are children or even teenager, we have the chance to discover all the pleasure of the life and not have enough distance or experience to find reasons to not enjoy every minute of our lives.

First of all, learning by discovering brings us so much pleasure that it is hard not to be excited about. For instance, when I think about my youth or the image I have from young people, I always see smile and imagine laugh on childrens face.
Secondly, when I look and hear about older peoples experience, I rarely observe so much good mood and pride to live. I more often see some sadness.This situation may be due because of todays society that tend to make things become more and more complex. In this kind of chaos, older people often go too far to get some pleasure. Older people tend to think too much rather than just living the moment and finding a way to enjoy.
Furthermore, when we compare an adult  who always find something to complain about his work, his family or his social status, to some younger people who are not aware of those problematics, even if it by ignorance that they seem to enjoy more, they still show it.
Moreover, and in order to fulfill part of my conception of enjoying, I strongly believe that young people, because they want to learn, take more risks that their older generation.Taking a risk is in one a way, the proof that we are enjoying the situation and that we do not try to find difficulties or reasons not to enjoy where they do not even exist.

Globally, even if children enjoy differently their lives since they can not have the ability to fully think about what enjoying really mean, they just enjoy by making life as easy as it just is.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements accurately portray products, many tend to exaggerate their benefits, creating an idealized image that often fails to match reality. This essay will argue that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, employing various techniques to entice consumers. 

One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often highlight the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. For example, a commercial for a new weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals who have achieved remarkable results, but fail to mention the potential side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise. This selective focus creates a misleading impression of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ persuasive language and imagery to evoke emotional responses in consumers. They may use catchy slogans, celebrity endorsements, or visually appealing scenes to create a sense of desire or need for the product. This emotional appeal can overshadow rational considerations and lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on unrealistic expectations. For instance, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous model in a luxurious setting, suggesting that using the product will transform the user into a more desirable and confident individual. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority tend to exaggerate the benefits of products to entice consumers. By selectively presenting information, employing persuasive language, and appealing to emotions, advertisers create an idealized image that often fails to reflect the reality of the product. Consumers should be aware of these tactics and exercise critical thinking when evaluating advertisements to avoid making uninformed purchasing decisions.",
"I do not agree with the statement, mainly for three reasons. The fist one is that old people have lived much more than younger people have and thus they have more experience in life, the second one is that the are more mature and for this reason they do not have extreme attitude changes as youngsters do and the last one is that old people have more money to spend since they are working.

With the experience that old people have in their lives, I mean that they have experienced many feelings and have been in many situations that young people have not, and then, they can take the maximum of each day, the enjoy any moment because they know that certain situations will never be repeated, they use to see the future and prepare for it while young people just want to live day by day, not worring about the future.

My second reason is that older people are more matture and thus they do not have that radical changes in attitude that young people have. Enjoying of this stability provides old people with a great advantage that can be used to dedicate the exact ammount of time to each activity, not wasting time like youngsters do. Also, this characteristic is important in order to keep risks away by making the correct decisions and to avoid doing stupid things.

Finally and not less important is the factor of the money. I would like to mention the importance of having financial stability in order to enjoy the life doing what we like. An old person has the opportunity to wok hard and save money to take some vacations or tavel around the world while a young person rarely has this opportunity because they are studiyng and it is hard for them to work and study at the same time. Because of this reason, older people can really enjoy life by doing great activities that will enrich their person.    

As a conclusion, I would like to say that old people enjoy more the life than younger people do. The reasons I have presented are just three but there are many other that can confirm that a mature person can enjoy a lot the life while the young people can be just living an illusory hapiness.",
"Technology is going on increasing day-by-day and many of the people are not getting stick to one thing . They are planning to get in touch with atleast something about the other subjects and gain  some knowledge about that. I partially agree with the statement ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"" because getting specialized in one area may be useful but the person must have atleast some idea about the others also.

                    For example ,B.Tech offers  number  of courses like Computers, Electrical, Mechanical , Communications etc..  Any student who joins in any of these courses come across some subjects related to these courses i.e. I'm a Computer Science student and I'll come across many subjects in my curriculum which include some Electrical  and Communications subjects also. Along with these I'll come across specialized subjects in Computers after two years. 

	      Specialized subjects give me the knowledge how to design ,analyze,code and test our projects that are going to be done in future. And if I would like to choose any of the field after my B.Tech I must have atleast some idea about the other subjects. If I would like to learn mobile repairing after my graduation I must have some idea about Cellular and Mobile Communications  which  I have already gone through in my curriculum. It make my work easy  in mobile repairing ,by having some idea about  the subject in advance.

                  By  summarizing the above points there is a need to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects and specialization in one specific subject  because ,if a person is interested in his own field he may go that side and others can get some benefit by having atleast some knowledge about  other subjects.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of happiness and the diverse experiences that shape our perception of life. While youth may be characterized by a sense of boundless energy and freedom, equating this with greater enjoyment is a flawed assumption. 

Firstly, enjoyment is subjective and influenced by individual circumstances and priorities. Young people may experience a heightened sense of excitement and novelty, but this can be overshadowed by anxieties about the future, pressure to succeed, and the constant need to prove themselves. Older individuals, on the other hand, may have achieved greater stability and financial security, allowing them to focus on pursuits that bring them genuine joy, such as travel, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones.

Furthermore, the concept of enjoyment evolves with age and experience. Young people may prioritize immediate gratification and fleeting pleasures, while older individuals may find satisfaction in deeper connections, personal growth, and the wisdom gained through years of living. For example, a young person might find immense joy in attending a concert, while an older person might derive greater satisfaction from volunteering in their community or mentoring younger generations.
In conclusion, attributing greater enjoyment to young people is a narrow perspective that overlooks the complexities of human experience. While youth may offer certain advantages, it is not a guarantee of happiness. True enjoyment is a multifaceted concept that transcends age and is shaped by individual circumstances, priorities, and the evolving nature of our values and aspirations.",
"In life, we are all seeking happiness. There are differents ways we use to hope to gain this happiness. Enjoying life is one of the important way that we all use to show that we are happy and the way we express it will depend very much on our age. For expample, a young person(under 40 years old) will seek the most intense way to enjoy life while an older person will seek long lasting happiness.In other wors, they don't enjoy life more but differently.
When you are young you are seeking temporary pleasure. You would like to have the most intense and the most recordable pleasure. You can not really think to tomorrow but how to do to take advantage of the present. Furthermore, the subject that can make you happy is different wrether you are young or older. For example, for a ten years old child, a bycicle can be a subject of enjoying life. For a teenager it can be his his first love relationship and so one. 
However an older person will seek for a more lasting subject to enjoy life .He will never spend his time going on disco club or drinking a lot to show that he is happy. As they are more reasonable, they will enjoy life more cautiously but the result is the same as for the younger person. He will also feel happy. For example, for a 50 years old person, his subjects of preoccupation is his retirement, his carreer's end...So he will enjoy life for example by going on holidays, by finding the best way to finance his retirement. 
To conclude, i would say that young people don't enjoy life more than older people do but they do it in a different way. Young people are always seeking ephemere pleasure while older people are seeking lasting pleasure. The time that this pleasure will last will grow with the age of the person.",
"I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. 

In my view there are a variety of arguments to support this statement:

First of all young people do not have as much duties as older people have. The do not really have to think about how to feed their families or how to raise and educate their childs. 
Consequently in my opinion young people have a lot more flexibility . For example when I want to go on holidays to visit some of my friends in Spain and can do it. As a unmarried student I do not have to ask a wife or a boss for the permission. 

Furthermore young people have more leisure time. You can not compare the time people spend at work with the time young people have to be present in school or university. Even when preparation time is added a regular job takes far more time. According to my personal experiences my leisure time and especially my holidays are twice as long as those from my father. 

Moreover young people are often in a better condition than older people. For me it is important to do as much sports as possible. I really enjoy to keep myself in shape and to train a lot. With regard to my father or my grandfather I noticed that older people are often injured or can not accomplish their own expectations. I recognized that this fact is every disappointing especially for my grandfather who had been an excelent sportsman. 

Taking everything into account I think that my years at school and university would propably be the best of my entire life. Therefore I am a little bit scared of growing older and be confronted with the presented disadvantages.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, older individuals often possess a deeper appreciation for life's nuances and a more profound sense of contentment. 

Firstly, young people are often burdened by the pressures of education, career choices, and financial instability. The constant pursuit of success and the fear of failure can create a significant amount of stress and anxiety, hindering their ability to truly enjoy the present moment. Conversely, older individuals have typically achieved a degree of stability and financial security, allowing them to focus on their passions and pursue activities that bring them genuine joy. For example, a retired teacher might find immense satisfaction in volunteering at a local library, sharing their knowledge and contributing to the community. 

Secondly, older people have accumulated a wealth of experiences and wisdom that allows them to navigate life's challenges with greater resilience and perspective. They have witnessed both triumphs and setbacks, learning valuable lessons along the way. This accumulated wisdom fosters a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the simple things in life, which can contribute to a higher level of contentment. In contrast, young people may be more prone to dwelling on their perceived shortcomings and comparing themselves to others, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with a certain level of carefree enjoyment, it is not necessarily indicative of a greater capacity for happiness. Older individuals often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and a more profound sense of contentment, derived from their accumulated experiences, wisdom, and stability. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them appear far better than they truly are. This tendency stems from the inherent nature of advertising, which aims to persuade and entice consumers. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information and misleading claims. For instance, advertisements for weight-loss products often showcase individuals with dramatic transformations, implying that similar results can be achieved by using the product. However, these advertisements rarely disclose the rigorous exercise routines and dietary changes that contribute to the individuals' success. This selective presentation creates an unrealistic expectation and misrepresents the product's true effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and psychological manipulation to create a sense of desire and urgency. By associating products with positive emotions, such as happiness, success, or love, advertisers attempt to evoke a subconscious connection between the product and these desirable feelings. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on fleeting desires rather than rational needs. 

In conclusion, the vast majority of advertisements employ various techniques to embellish the qualities of products, making them seem more appealing than they actually are. The use of selective information, misleading claims, and emotional appeals all contribute to this exaggeration. While advertising can be a valuable tool for informing consumers, it is crucial to be aware of its persuasive nature and to critically evaluate the information presented. By doing so, consumers can make informed decisions and avoid falling prey to the allure of exaggerated claims.",
"In today's world,  having a broad knowledge in several  academic subects is important to develop of a better job opportunity. We can see how competitive is the world now ; In one hand, people speak different lenguages, have different degress. In the other hand having just one specifict subject, which represents a great downfall for many students. Also we have to take into consideration that both ways represents is some way a difficult idea.

having access to several opportunities has change the life of millions of people around Canada;in fact, it is been prove the the most profitable jobs are taken by people who speaks more thant two lenguages and have a broad knowledge of different subjects this behaviour can transform you just by being able to solve problems and be capable to stand up  on the rapid evolution  of society.  

One sobject, represent a hing risk for the people in the future, simple because, It  will be more demand for eficient and rapid personal; For example,  If you are designed to develop a simple task, then something goes out of your hands, you will be stuck until some one else come and fix the problem. This type of situation cost money and time and that is the most important idea for many companies around the world

Now, if we see how crucial can be this topic, we will find out  that both oppinions represent a risk for many students.For example, If you have one, you are limited, but if you have several, you may get confused and fill affect all. Nobody knows how to get to the anwser yet, but  

In conclussion, the experiense of having different knowledge can add odds to  your life, Therefore. I feel that,  success is base in how much you know and that would be the key factor in order to get hired in the future",
"I totally agree with this statement. There are lots of advertisements in the world. All the advertisements about their goods contains the great exaggeration about their goods. 	
	In my experience, I was young and I was in Korea, I watched the advertisements about new robot toys. At that time on the Tv, it shows the flying robot that I can control it and make it fly. I was really surprised about flying thing because I was young. So I bought it at my birhday and tried to make it fly. It didn't fly. It was really big shock for me and I could not believe any advertisement from that time.
	In our life, we can see many cases like mine. In addition, I saw a advertisement about new restaurant, it says that if we come at birthday, it is free and there are alot of beneficial thing for birthday people. So I went to that restaurant with my friends on my birthday, I expected that free foods and many things. but i couldn't get any services or beneficial things. They said, it was only one week event so I checked the advertisement paper, it didn't mention about one week event. I was really angry but i couldn't leave that restaurant.
	In my opinion, we cannot stop them. Because it is one of the good way to make people come to their restaurant. But we can think ourselves that we know it is fake. So do not expect that much, we have to get ready for a shock. When we just don't believe the advertisement, we can have some benefit luckily, and it makes us happy. So my conclusion is , we know it is not really true but we can just go and have fun there.",
"we are in the XXI century and now I must write about the most advertisements that make products seem much better than they rally are.
I agree whit this idea because often many products that the people watch on tv or see around them,do not appear what they really are. In fact I thinck that the television introduces different ideas in the head of people.For example some people buy  only  shoes or the dress or gadgets that are sign by important   Many people do not know what is the true, because some products are good and have hight qualty. We can value these products for the material they are build, for their aspect, for their end.
The apparence is most important but I thinck that is not the most important element of vatulation, but for many people it is the only element of confronte some objects.
This idea is rediculeus because the apparence is not all in the life of the people.
For example, I am an architect, when I make a proget for a house I thinck that this house must be confortable ,beautiful, faschion, and help the people in the life. It must be the hause of live not only a beautiful house. By the way many people do not understand that a house or another kinds of products are good when each elements 
that compose the product must be in the sit good.",
"The issue at hand is young people enjoy life more than older people do or not. I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I believe that older people like life more than young people do because of many reasons. 

	First of all, old people enjoy life more than younger person do because they know they are much close to death. They know very well the meaning of death and  they will die in anytime. Because of this reason, they try to spend their rest of life very effectively. On the other hand, young people feel that they ever don't die and because of this reason they don't aware the value of life.

	Additionally, old people like life more than younger because they have many reasons to enjoy life. For example, they generally  have children and  a wife. They need to care about them.  They enjoy life because of her family. On the other hand, young people do not have a doughter or son. They are single. Because they do not have any concrete reason to glue life, they do not enjoy life more than older people.

	Finally, I think old people enjoy life more than younger people because their expectations from life are not generally big. They generally expect quiet place in peace with their family. This is enough for them to enjoy the life.  On the other hand, as I am a young man, I have many expectations from life and if I don't obtain any of them, I will easily hate from life and I will be depresed. I expect a good job, much money, brand new car...It is very difficult to obtain all of them at the same time and due to these reason most of time  I don't enjoy from life.

	Ultimately, I believe that old people enjoy life more than younger people do. I believe this because, the life will end for them in a very short time later, they have many things to do and many people to care, and they don't have a lot of expectations from the life.",

One compelling example of young people's dedication to their communities is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local food drives to advocating for environmental sustainability, young people are taking the lead in addressing social issues. For instance, the organization ""Youth for Climate Action"" has mobilized thousands of young people worldwide to participate in protests and campaigns aimed at raising awareness about climate change. This initiative demonstrates the passion and commitment of young people to make a difference in their communities. 

Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time and skills in various organizations and institutions. From working at soup kitchens to assisting at local hospitals, they contribute to the well-being of their communities. The ""Big Brothers Big Sisters"" program, for example, pairs young volunteers with children from disadvantaged backgrounds, providing mentorship and support. These volunteers dedicate their time and energy to making a positive impact on the lives of others, showcasing the genuine desire of young people to give back.

Their dedication and commitment to service demonstrate that they are not only concerned with their own lives but also invested in the well-being of their communities.",
from a wheel to a cart to a car to a plane and finally to a rocket man has acheived every thing he want.but in the process his life has become more mechanical and he began to do things for his own happiness than to the cause for the cause of others                                                                     now coming to the case of young people.i agree upon the fact that they are not giving enough time to help out the communities and the society in which they live.young people beacuse of their hectic schedule and  their outlook towards the society has changed many of them are not willing to help the communities.instead they like to enjoy their life in partying flurting>they have reached to such a stage that they had stopped giving birth for the coming generations in the look for their own enjoyment.                                                                                                                             every thing is becoming readymade in this modern world and the young people are becoming more sluggish and lethargic>young people are becoming more selfish day by day.the environment in which they are brought up is also one of the factor for the above cause.mass medias like telivisions music and computer are also distracting the young people from the way they used to think earlier.they are more willing to watch telivision or listen to music than helping out the society.the educational institutions are also becoming a cause.they are not including courses such as humanities in the regular courses which helps them to take the young people nearer to the community.young people are lacking ethical values in the case of helping a community.every thing they work is becoming so mechanical that they are lossing interest in helping mankind.another main cause is internet.young people instead of using it properly are exploiting it like they are addicted to watchj porn sites <porn films.chatting has also become one of the major cause                                                                                                                    with all these ultra modern facilities young people are becoming more vulnerable to get addicted to all bad habits.in order to avoid this in future they must be taken care properly from the childhood itself .they must be taught on moral values principles.special organizations should come up to teach all these and educational institutes must also play a viotal role in helping the young people to inculcate good habits.parents who are not worrying about their children these days must learn to teach the children some basic moral values.,
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a diverse intellectual foundation fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and make informed decisions. By understanding concepts from various disciplines, one can analyze information from multiple perspectives, identify biases, and draw more comprehensive conclusions. For instance, a student with knowledge of both history and economics can better understand the causes and consequences of economic crises, considering both historical context and economic principles.
Secondly, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's interconnected society, individuals are constantly encountering new challenges and opportunities. A diverse knowledge base allows them to navigate these complexities, applying insights from different fields to solve problems and seize new possibilities. For example, a person with a background in literature and technology might be better equipped to adapt to the evolving landscape of digital media.
Finally, a broad knowledge base promotes a more holistic understanding of the world. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge and the complexities of human experience. This fosters empathy, tolerance, and a more nuanced perspective on global issues. For instance, studying both science and art can lead to a richer understanding of the human condition and the role of creativity in scientific discovery.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers invaluable advantages. It cultivates critical thinking, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world, preparing individuals for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. By embracing a diverse intellectual foundation, we can become more informed, adaptable, and engaged citizens of the world.",
"I may agree with the statement or may desagree. The enjoying in life depends of young people and older, like elderly people.

Young people would rather  to spend time on computer than to read a book if they have had the oppotunity to choice between them. The most f elderly people might choice to read a book, and another younger people may choice any way.

Young people like child or teenagers migth expect life to show many ways to make them happy or funny. That is why there are in their minds how come they spend good time and easy life.

They have their parents or tutor support their studies and even support life style and they are not able to spend these kind of things.. 
In the other hand, older people should make ends meets to life, if they did colect enough money, or life by their jobs, depends the case. Most of them have on their mind the way to spend life, that is way, they do not expected the life to show an enjoy life. They might think to spend a good life trying to enjoy, however it is too difficult, enjoy and spend good life everytime, than the most of young people are able to get.

The psicology of both kind of person are quite different, but in same cases older people could get good life and enjoy life. Their jobs and professions get to them a nice way to life.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and fostering collective action. For instance, the recent surge in online activism surrounding environmental issues demonstrates the power of young people to advocate for change and mobilize their peers. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work and community organizations. From volunteering at local soup kitchens and animal shelters to participating in environmental clean-up projects, they contribute their time and skills to address pressing social issues. Many schools and universities also encourage community service, providing opportunities for students to gain valuable experience and make a difference in their local communities. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms. Young people may not always engage in traditional volunteer activities, but they contribute to their communities in other ways. For example, they may support local businesses, participate in community events, or simply be kind and helpful to those around them. These seemingly small acts of kindness can have a significant impact on the well-being of a community. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, young people are actively engaged in making a difference. By recognizing and celebrating their efforts, we can foster a culture of community engagement and empower them to continue making positive contributions to society.",
"Today, people watch more and more tv and see more and more advertisements. Sometimes people are surprised by some product efficiency, and sometimes he believe that is fake. So the question is to know if the advertisements show us the truh or fakes.

On the first hand, I agree whiththe statement that the advertisement make products bettrer than they are.

At first, the advertisement lie to us. In fact we watch tv, we are often surprise by the high qualitu of the products we see,  but this is dute to the specials effect the advertisers used to acttract us. As a consensequent some car advertiser try to make us believe than by using his new car we will be younger and younger.

Another idea is that the advertisers try to sell their products with showing us effects wich are impossible measure. As a consequent, a great trade of perfume wqnt to make the teenagers believe that thanks to their perfume every girl will be wildly attracted by them.

On the second sight, advertisement is just the reflect of the reality.

 Actually, the advertise is just here to inform us from the new improvements of the products, end cose of the shortness of the time the advertisers have to show us their products, they have to summurise their ideas in order to inform us about what their new product can do for us. As  a consequent they use many pictures, special effects, and the accelerate the efficiency of the products in the advertisement in order to show us the results more quickly.

"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local clean-up drives to advocating for environmental sustainability, young people are taking the lead in addressing pressing issues. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their commitment to making a difference. These young activists are not only raising awareness but also mobilizing their peers to take action, demonstrating a profound dedication to their communities.
Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time and skills to support various organizations. From tutoring underprivileged children to assisting at local soup kitchens, they contribute to the well-being of their communities in tangible ways. These acts of service not only benefit those in need but also foster a sense of empathy and responsibility in young individuals.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From leading social movements to volunteering their time, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact. To dismiss their efforts as insufficient is to overlook the significant contributions they make to the betterment of society.",
"There is an arguement concerning whether it is beneficial for people to have broad knowledge of many fields or to specialize in one particular subject. Although it is true that one specific knowledge can be more efficient, I believe that broad knowledge has many advantages. In this essay, I will briefly two reasons supporting my idea.

  Most of all, people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can study their own fields. In particular, in the science research, scientist who have a variety of knowledge can be obtain ideas about his research from different subjects. For example, I read an article of one physicist whom I do not remember his name. He said that he often gain his ideas about physics research from literature. Besides, the paradigm of subject are shifted in 21st centry. In 21th centry, many subjects are combined with other subjects which are not related them. For instance, physicist can adjust his knowledge to the medical science or biology, and economist can use scientific methods to analize economic materials. In this respect, knowing many academic subjects have many benefits to study.

  Moreover, having broad knowledge can make life more plentiful. Particularly, person who have many academic subjects can talk and discuss with people who have different jobs or major. Therefore, he can enjoy various kinds of subjects and make friends who is in different field. This make his life more exciting and plentiful. Besides, people who have different subjects with their major can applicate this knowledge his level of living better. For example, my uncle is professor of biology but he also knows well about economy. He adjust his knowledge about economy to invest stock, and he earn mucy money.

  In conclusion, having a wide range of knowledge is better on account of reasons that I mentioned above : various knowledge can contribute to not only the reseach and study in many fields, but also make more plentiful life.",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a topic of much debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in the long run. This is because a well-rounded education equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, fosters critical thinking, and promotes a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to adapt to changing circumstances. In a world where industries are constantly evolving and new technologies emerge at an unprecedented pace, having a diverse range of knowledge can be invaluable. For example, a student with a broad understanding of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) may be better equipped to transition into a new field or adapt to technological advancements than someone with a narrow specialization.
Secondly, a broad education fosters critical thinking skills. By exposing individuals to different perspectives and disciplines, a broad knowledge base encourages them to question assumptions, analyze information from multiple angles, and develop independent thought. This ability to think critically is essential for navigating complex problems and making informed decisions in a rapidly changing world.
Finally, a broad knowledge base promotes a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. By studying various subjects, individuals can see how different disciplines relate to each other and how knowledge from one field can inform another. This holistic perspective allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the world and its complexities.
In conclusion, while specialization can be valuable, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It equips individuals with the adaptability, critical thinking skills, and holistic understanding necessary to thrive in a dynamic and interconnected world. Therefore, I believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",
"I completely agree with this statement, because i think adverstisement have been developped to sell products, and consequently it had to impress the mind of the consumer. Who creates the advertisement must present the product in the best way he`s able to do, also in order to defeat the challenging industries, that is, the other industries which sell the same object.
To obtain this, the creators of the advertisement must present the product in a way that will make the consumer believe he`s going to do the right choice, and for these reasons the companies tent to present their products much better than they really are.
To explain this concept, we could focus the attention on an industry which produces cars : if this company is going to launch on the market a new model of car, surely it will spend a lot of money in advertisement. Since the aim of the advertisement is making a person buy that new product, the car will be presented as a wonderfull object, full of technologies and of services created directly in order to satisfy the consumer ; even if  this description was wrong, the consumer will be influenced in any case.
For these reasons, advertisement is merely created to influence society, and not to describe the real essence of the product; talking about this problem, in this years many companies and associations have been founded to protect the consumer, since people can be easily cheated by the market, and consequently after they buying a product, they rapidly discover that it is very different from the one they had seen on the advertisement.
Concluding, we have to say that while it`s very common than companies present their product much better than they really are, the consumers must reflect well upon the choice they are made, and be sure they are not buying an useless object just because they have been influenced by the advertisement they have seen somewhere.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the multifaceted nature of happiness and the diverse experiences that shape our perceptions of life. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance and a sense of limitless possibilities, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, older individuals often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and a more nuanced appreciation for the simple pleasures.
One key difference lies in the perspective on time. Young people often view time as an endless resource, leading them to prioritize immediate gratification and fleeting experiences. Conversely, older individuals, having witnessed the passage of time, tend to value experiences that hold lasting significance. They may find joy in cultivating meaningful relationships, pursuing personal passions, and contributing to society. For example, a retired teacher who volunteers at a local library may derive immense satisfaction from sharing their knowledge and fostering a love of reading in young minds.
Furthermore, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. While young people may find excitement in adrenaline-pumping activities or social gatherings, older individuals may find contentment in quiet moments of reflection, spending time with loved ones, or engaging in hobbies that bring them peace. The joy of a grandparent watching their grandchild's first steps is a profound experience that transcends the fleeting pleasures of youth.
In conclusion, the assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a flawed assumption. While youth may offer certain advantages, older individuals often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and a more nuanced appreciation for the simple pleasures. Ultimately, enjoyment is a subjective experience that varies greatly across individuals and life stages. It is not a matter of age but rather a matter of perspective and the ability to find fulfillment in the unique circumstances of each individual's journey.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly across individuals. A young person might find immense joy in the thrill of new experiences, while an older person might derive satisfaction from the quiet contentment of established routines and deep relationships.
For example, a young adult might prioritize travel and adventure, while a seasoned professional might find fulfillment in their career achievements and family life.

Secondly, the challenges and pressures faced by different age groups are vastly different. Young people often grapple with the anxieties of identity formation, academic pressures, and financial instability. Older individuals, on the other hand, may confront health concerns, the loss of loved ones, and the realization of their own mortality. While these challenges can be difficult, they also offer opportunities for growth, resilience, and a deeper understanding of life's complexities.

In conclusion, it is unfair and inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. Both age groups experience a unique set of joys and challenges, and the concept of enjoyment is subjective and multifaceted.
Ultimately, the quality of life is not determined by age but by individual circumstances, perspectives, and choices.",
"I agree that young people nowadays do not offer enough time to helping their communities.  Considering too many entertainments in their environment and too many academic assignments in their school, and too less timie to rest, young people certainly spend insufficient time on their community-related tasks. 
First, it is too many attractive entertainments in our modern society that make young people indulge themselves in these entertainments. For example, in my dewelling city, there are full of all kinds of  entertainments, such as pub, movie theaters, and department stores. The young people spend their each weekend and holidays on shopping, seeing the movies, and playing. As a result, they have less willingness to devote to their communities.
Second, it is a great number of school assignments that prevent young people from attending community affairs. Today, young students have more homework, assignments, and quizzes to complete than before. Because of the more accessibility of of knowledge and information, young people are required to do more practice and take more examinations during their education, which reduce their possibility to join communities.
Finally, it is lack of enough resting time that young people might not have extra energy to engage in the community affairs. For example, in my country, young students have to attend cram school after formal school classes. Also, they are expected to take various art or music classes only because their parents ask them to do so. In this case, they couldn't have enough time to rest, not to mention that they plan to help their communities.
In summary, I agree that today, young people give much less time to helping their communities for several reasons, which may be mentioned above, too many time on entertainments and school assignments and less time to rest.",
"Do young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities? It seems to me that the answer is negative.

  On this modern society, young people face more and more pressure under their school works. They may go to private school in the evening and burn the midnight oil after going home. Tey are expected only the good grades. Most of the adults only focus on their performances on test. They haven't been taught to care more about our society.

  The sircumstance of this situation is very serious. We may ask ourselves what kind of people these young people will be after finishing their education. They may become selfish and don't see the big picture.It will be a disaster that if they would be the leader of our country in the future.

  There are still lots of things we can do to change this sircumstance. We need to let our young people spend more time to helping their communities to let them be more familiar with our society. It will help they to think they are parts of the communities and should do something good to our communities.

  They will feel more connections to the society during the time they spend on the communities. It will help not only our communities to have more people to get involved in it but also the young people themselves to have the chance to get matured by the process they experience.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods and services, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the reality, making products seem far better than they truly are. This exaggeration is achieved through a variety of techniques, including selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight loss product might showcase individuals with dramatic transformations, but fail to mention the rigorous exercise and dietary restrictions required to achieve such results. This selective approach creates a misleading impression of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely heavily on emotional appeals to connect with consumers. They use heartwarming stories, celebrity endorsements, or aspirational imagery to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. These emotional triggers can cloud judgment and make consumers more susceptible to purchasing products that may not actually meet their needs. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous woman surrounded by admirers, suggesting that using the product will lead to similar social success. 

Finally, advertisements frequently present unrealistic portrayals of products and their benefits. They use sophisticated editing techniques, special effects, and carefully chosen models to create an idealized image that is unattainable in real life. A car commercial might depict a sleek vehicle effortlessly navigating winding roads, while in reality, the car may struggle with everyday driving conditions. This discrepancy between the advertised image and the actual product can lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction for consumers. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative and entertaining, they often rely on exaggeration and manipulation to make products seem more appealing than they truly are. By employing selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals, advertisers create a distorted perception of reality, leaving consumers vulnerable to misleading claims and ultimately, dissatisfaction with their purchases.",
"I do strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people can do. 
	First of all i think that young people have something that frequently is not possesed by elderly ; that is good health. Good health means basically the possibility to travel all around the world and visit exciting new countries. It means also the possibility to practice new sports in the countryside or outside in the fresh air. For example 
But it is also necessary to live with dignity.
	Secondly, young people do not generally have great and impellent responsabilities but they can have a lot of freedom to go out with friends, go dancing , practice known sports , stay up late without any problem.
	Moreover the fact that elderly people can have some problems in concentrating and remembering the things they learn. This problem can seriously affect their chance to learn new things reading books, which I believe it is one of the greatest things to do to enjoy. Another really important fact is that young people have a great social life which often lacks in older people.
	To end up i would like to touch a very important issue that sadly affects our developed countries. In several important and crowded cities in the world it would be easy to find the majority of old people left alone in desolated apartments or even wostly in retirement houses.  The frenetic rythm of our society seem to emarginate the people regarded as unuseful so it is impossible for them to live in a life in wich every day is seen as a possible to enjoy life.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram allow them to mobilize volunteers for local causes, raise awareness about pressing issues, and even fundraise for charitable organizations. For instance, the #BlackLivesMatter movement, which began with a social media campaign, has inspired young people across the globe to engage in protests, donate to charities, and advocate for racial justice. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly drawn to volunteer work that aligns with their passions and interests. This shift towards purpose-driven volunteering allows them to make a meaningful contribution while pursuing their own goals. For example, a young person passionate about environmental conservation might volunteer at a local wildlife sanctuary, while another interested in technology might contribute to a coding program for underprivileged children. 

Finally, the traditional model of community service is evolving to encompass a wider range of activities. Young people are now actively involved in online activism, digital literacy programs, and social entrepreneurship ventures that address contemporary challenges. These efforts demonstrate their commitment to creating positive change, even if they don't always involve traditional forms of volunteering. 

In conclusion, while there may be some young people who prioritize personal interests over community involvement, it's inaccurate to claim that they are not contributing. The reality is that young people are actively engaged in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways, demonstrating their commitment to making a difference in the world.",
"In the tapestry of knowledge, the question of whether breadth or depth is more valuable has been a subject of debate for centuries. While specialization offers profound expertise in a particular field, I believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic subjects is ultimately more advantageous. This perspective is rooted in the inherent interconnectedness of knowledge, the adaptability it fosters, and the enriched understanding it provides.
Firstly, the world is increasingly interconnected, and problems often require solutions that draw upon insights from diverse disciplines. A specialist in one field might struggle to grasp the complexities of a multifaceted issue. For instance, a biologist might find it challenging to address environmental concerns without understanding the economic and political factors involved. A broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to synthesize information from various sources, leading to more comprehensive and effective solutions.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. Specialization can make individuals vulnerable to obsolescence as technology and societal needs evolve. Conversely, a wide range of knowledge allows individuals to readily transition to new fields, adapt to emerging technologies, and pursue diverse career paths. For example, a student with a broad background in humanities and sciences might be well-suited for careers in data analysis, policy research, or even entrepreneurship.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in today's interconnected and dynamic world. It fosters a deeper understanding of complex issues, enhances adaptability, and opens up a wider range of opportunities. By embracing a multidisciplinary approach to learning, individuals can become more well-rounded, adaptable, and ultimately more successful in navigating the challenges of the 21st century.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the benefits of products, making them seem far better than they truly are. This manipulation is achieved through various techniques that exploit human desires and vulnerabilities. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They often highlight only the positive aspects of a product, conveniently omitting any drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a weight loss product might showcase individuals achieving dramatic transformations in a short period, while failing to mention the potential side effects or the need for consistent effort. This selective presentation creates an unrealistic expectation that the product will deliver miraculous results, which is rarely the case. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to persuade consumers. They use evocative imagery, catchy slogans, and celebrity endorsements to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. These emotional triggers can cloud judgment and make consumers more likely to overlook the actual value of the product. For example, an advertisement for a luxury car might feature a glamorous couple enjoying a scenic drive, associating the product with feelings of freedom and success. This emotional connection can overshadow any rational assessment of the car's performance or practicality. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can provide valuable information about products, they often prioritize persuasion over accuracy. By selectively presenting information, appealing to emotions, and creating unrealistic expectations, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Consumers must be aware of these manipulative tactics and exercise critical thinking when evaluating advertising claims.",
"The question asks about tecqnology. In my opinion academic subjectsis better to have borad knowledhge than specialize in one specific subject. There are severl reasons shows at the bottom, why i disagree.
	
	First, the world is developing really fast. A centry ago people thinks specific subject is more important than acadamic subjects. Also number of people still thinks specific subjuct is more important than academic subject. I would say that is wrong. If you have job like writer, musical job, artist or Singer that migt better to have broad knowledge of may specific subject. But the world is developing really fast people need to follow the tecqnology. There are how to learn many academic subject. School in one of good case. Most of high school in korean which I was from, learn more mathemathic, physics , chemistry, Biology or computer. I believe the school is better to learn knowledge than others. 

	Second, I will give a different example about Korea  Korea has good IT tecqnology. So most of people working in computer part or science part. There are severl example about academic knowledge. The company needs employees also the employee have to have enough knoledge. In case I have a computer company. I need a 5 people need to work in my factory which makes CPU. Most of people knows what is CPU some are not. People call CUP is the brain in computer which means it is the most important part in computer. So I need to make the most important part, need to find people learned about ' how to make CPU'. Before learn that subject they need a lot of information about compter, that have to learn in high school but it might be a basic thing. Go to far, Unibersity or colloage. Good Unibersity or colloage need high grade. Most of course in high schools are academic subjects.

	World is developing people need to follow that other ways we can not developing more and more. What I am saying now is the learning. In the learning I am saying 'Academic Subjects'",

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and persuasive language to evoke a sense of desire or need in consumers. They may use catchy slogans, celebrity endorsements, or heartwarming stories to create an emotional connection with the product.

"In my opinion,it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
Having broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects gives us a lot of information about various topics.This helps us to identify the area or subject in which we are interested.For example,an individual who has knowledge in Arts,History,Economics and Sciences will have a larger scope to select his interested area of study and pursue his higher education in that domain.But by specializing in one specific subject,the scope of selection of other interested subjects is lost.
 
Also,broad knowledge of various subjects gives us a larger scope for inter-disiplinary work.Having considerable knowledge of two inter-relating topics,can help us understand the subjects much better.For example,having knowledge of Mathematics can help a lot in studying Physics.Modern world demands integration of more than one technology.

Also,it would improve the job oppurtunities.As the world moves towards development,the companies which hire individuals wants them to be flexible enough to work on more than one project at a time.Individuals who have broad knowledge of various academic subjects are helpful in this regard.Moreover,having knowledge of more than one subject will always be helpful in job search.Also there are certain jobs which require the knowledge of more than one subject.For example,for an effective design of an automobile,it would be better to hire a person who have knowledge of Mechanical Engineering and also who can simulate designs on a Computer system there by reducing  the manufacturing costs by a great deal. 

From the above facts,I conclude that it is better to have broad knowledge of various academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.We need individuals who are multi-talented to make innovations and make society a better place to live.",

While it is true that some advertisements employ deceptive tactics, I disagree with the notion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 

Firstly, the purpose of advertising is to attract consumers, and this often involves highlighting the positive aspects of a product. However, this does not necessarily equate to deception.
For example, a car advertisement might emphasize the vehicle's fuel efficiency and safety features, which are genuine qualities.
It is up to the consumer to research and evaluate the product based on their own needs and priorities.
Secondly, many advertisements are truthful and transparent.
Companies often use testimonials from real customers, showcase product demonstrations, and provide detailed information about features and specifications.
These elements allow consumers to make informed decisions based on factual information.
For instance, a beauty product advertisement might feature before-and-after photos of real users, demonstrating the product's effectiveness.
Finally, it is important to note that consumers are not passive recipients of advertising messages.
We are bombarded with advertisements daily, and we have developed a critical eye for discerning genuine claims from exaggerated ones.
We can easily recognize when an advertisement is overly promotional or uses unrealistic imagery.

"It is undeniable that advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and driving purchasing decisions. However, the statement that ""Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" is a generalization that requires careful consideration. While it is true that some advertisements employ exaggerated claims and misleading imagery, it is unfair to paint all advertising with the same brush. 

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that advertising serves a crucial purpose: informing consumers about available products and services. In a competitive market, companies need to highlight the unique features and benefits of their offerings to stand out. This often involves emphasizing positive aspects and downplaying potential drawbacks. However, this does not necessarily equate to deception. For instance, a car advertisement might showcase the vehicle's sleek design and powerful engine, but it is unlikely to explicitly mention its fuel efficiency or potential maintenance issues.

Secondly, consumers are not passive recipients of advertising messages. They have access to a wealth of information, including reviews, comparisons, and independent testing results. This empowers them to make informed decisions and separate hype from reality. Furthermore, regulations and consumer protection laws exist to prevent outright false or misleading advertising.

"Do you want to enjoy your life? There is many ways of enjoying your life. What I think of enjoying a life is to be fun, and proud of what you are doing at all time. I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do, because what ever you do, the age does not matter, have more experiences, and they should understand the importance of enjoying their lifes.
	Some people enjoy their life at all time, but the other does not enjoy it all the time. Some even does not enjoy their life at all. To enjoy your life, what can you do? For example, I would go shopping and hang out with my friends. I believe that is what most of young people would do. Talk with friends, doing what you want to do. Although does this have to be young people? The answer is no. Older people can also go shopping and hang out with their friends. There is no such things that young people can do and the older can not. 
	Older people have more experience to many things. Therefore they can always challenge themselves to do something harder. This gives the guts to do and overcome what they had done before. They also can do the things that they had done long ago and feel like they are young again. 
	As you get older, you begin to understand the importance of time more. As young people just willing what they want to do, and ignoreing what they does not want to do, old people prefer to do what they can do.

"In the following essay I shall be concerned with the question whether young people enjoy life more than older people do.

Generally, I agree with this statement but there are some exceptions and remarkable points to be acknowledged before taking a too fast conclusion.
In my case, I'm 25 years old and I'm enjoying my life very well. Im going out on the night, taking long travels in the holidays and other time- and breathtaking hobbies, which are a giving a me a kind of resting and relaxing besides my work. For doing so, you need the time and a special sense of personal feeling.
Taking all of these examples in contradiction to my parents or my grandparents, which are much older than me, for sure, I'm able to do go out very often during the week, visiting some bars and a disco afterwards and do not suffer on the next day although if I spent the night in the city till dawn. In my opinion, this point of suffering will be compareable in some sports situations. For me, sport is my life and I cannot imagine to live without it. Therefore, I'm studying Sports Science and I did several disciplines throughout my lifetime in a way my parents, respectively my grandparents weren't, and especially now aren't able to match. But these two examples are based on the personal constitution of the human body, which is unique and also changing during everybodys life. 
So, it should be remarked, that both of my grandparents and their heirs have different things to enjoy their life, none of which I can imagine to like or to spend many hours by doing them. Nevertheless, all of those fulfilled them with happyness and make them enjoying their life. 
Finally, I think that a basic solution of this question is based whether you are can understand everybodys way how to fulfill and to enjoy his life during the different ages.",
"A graet man said before in a long time ago "" the small ones are the once who rise the city up or take it down "" . His words were right because that was the truth .

      Nowadays kids refuse to help others and they won't give enough time and effort to help thier community . I think that  this is a great big fact . So , I agree with the statment for two resones .

     First , nowaday teenagers don't do what they are supposed to do and they don't carry the responsibility of thier behaviors . They always act sush as babies and never care about any thing exept if they will have something as an effort if they took care about that thing. That's a bad  acting and won't help them even when they grow up because that effects thier community . In this way , thier children will act the same way and there won't be any exampels of cooporation .

     Another thing is that the young people are more active and have more potinsules , so they can effored more than the older ones and they truly can rise their community by helping it and taking with it hand . And so , every one can live in a nice , loving and cooporatoinal sosiaty . 

     In the end , I would refear that young poeple should do thier jobs and help their community to rise and be better .",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a sense of boundless energy and freedom, older individuals often possess a deeper appreciation for life's nuances and a more profound sense of contentment.


Firstly, youth is often associated with a carefree spirit and a lack of responsibility. Young people are typically less burdened by financial worries, family obligations, or the weight of past experiences. This allows them to embrace new experiences and pursue their passions with a sense of abandon. For example, a young person might travel the world, explore different careers, or engage in adventurous activities with little regard for the consequences. However, this freedom comes at a cost. Young people may lack the maturity and wisdom to fully understand the implications of their choices, leading to impulsive decisions and potential regrets.


In contrast, older people have often navigated the complexities of life and learned from their mistakes. They have a greater understanding of their values and priorities, allowing them to focus on what truly matters to them. While they may not have the same level of physical energy as younger individuals, they possess a wealth of experience and a deeper appreciation for the simple pleasures in life. For instance, an older person might find joy in spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or simply enjoying the peace and quiet of their surroundings.


Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is subjective and depends on individual circumstances and perspectives. While youth may offer a sense of freedom and adventure, older individuals often possess a deeper understanding and appreciation for life's complexities. Both stages of life have their own unique joys and challenges, and it is impossible to definitively claim that one group enjoys life more than the other.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception, often fueled by romanticized views of youth. While it's true that young people may experience a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they enjoy life more than their older counterparts is a sweeping generalization.
Both age groups have unique advantages and challenges that shape their experiences and perceptions of happiness.
One argument against the statement is that older people have a greater appreciation for life's simple pleasures. They have likely experienced a wider range of emotions, both positive and negative, and have learned to value the small things. For example, a seasoned traveler might find more joy in a quiet cup of coffee than a young person who is constantly seeking new thrills.
Furthermore, older people often have more financial stability and freedom, allowing them to pursue hobbies and interests that bring them genuine satisfaction.
However, it's important to acknowledge that young people have a unique energy and enthusiasm that can be infectious. They are often more open to new experiences and less burdened by past regrets. This can lead to a sense of adventure and excitement that is difficult to replicate later in life. For instance, a young person might find immense joy in backpacking across Europe, while an older person might prefer a more relaxed vacation.
Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is subjective and depends on individual circumstances and perspectives. While young people may have a certain carefree spirit, older people have a wealth of experience and wisdom that can contribute to their happiness. Both age groups have their own unique advantages and challenges, and it's unfair to claim that one enjoys life more than the other.
The key to a fulfilling life lies in embracing the present moment and finding joy in the journey, regardless of age.",
"It is better to specialized in one specific subject than to have broad knowlege of academic subject.
 
First of all, human brain is limited there are cuntless of books and knowlege in the world that human being has achieved. It's surely  impossible that one individual has all that knowlege.Beside if we want to broaden our knowlege the depth of it would be shallow. 
However, if we specialize in one subgect,still it woul be a lot to do,it woul be much easier than to have broad knowlege,and we can deepen it by study and all kinds of efforts.

 Second, there'are lot's of college graduators in the world. However if they have same level of knowlege.,it would be not helpful for each other.In society,we can't live with other's help. We need doctor's in hosptal ,but also nurses and pharmasist. It is efficient and easier to divide the work than one person does the all the jobs. 

 Third, we need to relay our accomplishment to our next generations like our former generation did. If our ancestors haven't acheive anything, there would be no civilization and industralizaion of present time. 

The world is developing by the people who study in specific subject. We call them specialist. Without specialists the world is not going to be develonped any",
"When one goes on to pursue a higher level of eductaion ,  one normaly has the choice to major in a specific subject or have a broader and more general approach to several subjects. Normally , one's first year of university is where he or she makes that discision and sticks with it for four years. Which f the two would i prefer? In this essay i will demonstrate why choosing a specific subject to specialize in would be the better way to go.

Today, jobs are becoming harder and harder to find. After universtiy, I either have to choice to cary one with a higher level of study and master the subject i majored in or to move on into the working world. Every person's goal in life is to achieve wealth and happiness , but how would one reach that goal if he or she isn't qualified enough.Companies are looking for fresh garduates who have studied in a specific field and know what they are doing. They must also have a minimum of experience that goes along with the extensive studying. Once he or she have passed their learning process they can move on to use their ares of expertease in the working world where they will acquire good jobs and be well paid and maybe some day be the top of their field.

Studying with a broad knowledge and not specificly have an area of expertease may have one advantage and that is where he or she had a more enteresting learning experience and a wider general knowledge. But this waya of learning isn't complete one can't find good work if he or she isn't well trained in a specific field. And I think that haveing a job is more important than having a wide general knowledge.

In conclusion one must focus in a single are of study to achive high goals in life and reach welath and happiness as it is the most important thing to support a family and live a fullfilled life.",
"Nowadays mostly people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. 
I totally disagree with this statement. 
There are three reasons why I have this preference.

For one thing people who are young have to spent their time with working and learning in order to get a job in the future.
I am student. I have to study the whole day. And when I have finished my semester I have to work at a shipping company in order to get money. I have so much work and I have totally no time at all to see my friends. Only a few times I try to go out to enjoy my life.

Furthermore many young people are in concern about their future.
In consequence they do not enjoy life. There is a great competition surrounding the young people. Many of them have no work, they do not get a traineeshipment or they are not admitted on a university.
I have to reach 90 points in the toefl test otherwise I will be exmatriukulated. If I fail I have to find out another way how to earn money in the future. I am really frightened about this case.

A next point is, that I have not as much money as the older people have. I get only some money from the company at which I work within my free time. Because I do not work full time I get less money. From this money I have to pay my appartment, the university fee, the ticket for the train and I need money for food and clothes. There is no further money which I can spend for fun like for holiday trips.

In conclusion you can see that young people do not enjoy their life as many people do believe.  The majority have to spent their time on working and learning, they are more in concern about their future and as result they less enjoy life. Finally they have less money which they could spend for having fun. Only when you are old and you have reached something wthin your life you will really enjoy life.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception, often fueled by romanticized views of youth. While it's true that young people might experience a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they enjoy life more is a sweeping generalization that ignores the multifaceted nature of happiness and the unique joys each stage of life offers. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves with time. Young people might prioritize excitement and novelty, finding joy in exploring new experiences and pushing boundaries. However, older people often derive satisfaction from the stability and depth of their relationships, the fulfillment of their careers, and the wisdom gained through years of living. They might find joy in quiet moments of reflection, appreciating the beauty of their surroundings, or nurturing their passions. 

Furthermore, the challenges and responsibilities faced by each generation contribute to their perspective on life. Young people might feel pressure to succeed academically, professionally, and socially, leading to stress and anxiety. Older people, on the other hand, might face the challenges of health issues, financial concerns, or the loss of loved ones. While these challenges can be difficult, they also foster resilience, empathy, and a deeper appreciation for the preciousness of life. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not a competition between age groups. Both young and old have the potential to experience profound joy and fulfillment, albeit in different ways. While young people might revel in the thrill of the unknown, older people can find contentment in the wisdom and stability they have cultivated. It's important to acknowledge the unique joys and challenges of each stage of life and celebrate the richness and diversity of human experience.",
"In today's consumerist society, advertisements play a crucial role in shaping our perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the benefits of products, making them seem far superior to their actual capabilities. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the desire to attract consumers and boost sales, often at the expense of truthfulness. 

One compelling example of this exaggeration is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing and photo editing in beauty advertisements. Models are often portrayed with flawless skin, impossibly long limbs, and unrealistic proportions, creating an unattainable standard of beauty. This manipulation of images leads consumers to believe that the products will deliver similar results, which is rarely the case. The reality is that these products may offer some benefits, but they cannot magically transform individuals into the idealized versions presented in advertisements. 

Furthermore, advertisements often employ persuasive language and emotional appeals to create a sense of urgency and desirability. They may use phrases like ""limited-time offer"" or ""exclusive deal"" to trigger a fear of missing out, prompting consumers to make impulsive purchases. This manipulative tactic obscures the true value of the product and encourages consumers to prioritize immediate gratification over rational decision-making. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately portray the features of products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits to entice consumers. The use of deceptive imagery, persuasive language, and emotional appeals creates a distorted perception of reality, leading consumers to make uninformed decisions. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the claims made in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"I fully agree with the captioned statement. As a member of young people generation, I believe that we should find much more time to dedicate to and help our communities.

The society in which we currently live put al lot of pressure on young generations in order to push them to think about their studies and their carrers. The messages that young people receive from family, school, work are not oriented to develop a feeling of the community where  they live. On my opinion, our society is building selfish people concentrated on their own interest and goals.

I am currently leaving in Milan, the business capital of Italy. In Milan the feeling of living in a community is quite disappeared. By this, I mean that we are all concentrated on our projects and we work so hard that we do not have time to think about ourselves. We all live as single people with amazingly working hours that do not allow to think or to find spare time for a community. 

This mechanins is completly wrong because it destroys the sense of community and all the benefits that a community can bring.

I remember, when I was living and studying in a small village where my parents currently live, before moving to Milan, that I always appreciated the existence of a community. We all knew eachother at that time, because the village was very small. If someone needed help, everone was willing to give their support. The families in the community were very closed to eachother. I personally grew up with many other children of other families of the communities and we were obliged to help people with some difficulties. I remember that I was teaching at that time Italian language to foreign little children, coming from Africa but living in our community, and I was so happy to be of help.

In conclusion, I believe that communities are very important for our lives. They can greatly contribute to our needs. For this reason, young people should keep alive the sense of community and make a lot of effort in finding time to help their communities. I can affirm that helping your community can be very rewarding and that life is not only made by your personal goals and career.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, a significant number actively engage in community initiatives, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led organizations focused on addressing social issues. From environmental activism groups like Fridays for Future to initiatives promoting literacy and education, young people are taking the lead in tackling challenges that affect their communities. These individuals dedicate their time and energy to organizing events, raising awareness, and advocating for positive change.

Furthermore, the advent of social media has provided a platform for young people to connect with others and mobilize collective action. Online platforms allow them to organize volunteer drives, fundraise for charitable causes, and amplify the voices of marginalized communities. This digital activism demonstrates a willingness to use their skills and resources to make a difference.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about an entire generation, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which young people contribute to their communities. From traditional volunteer work to innovative online activism, they are actively engaged in addressing social issues and creating a better future. The statement that they do not give enough time to helping their communities is simply not accurate.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's academic horizons is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having broad knowledge across multiple subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual flexibility, promotes interdisciplinary thinking, and prepares individuals for a rapidly evolving world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's dynamic job market, skills and knowledge are constantly evolving. Those with a diverse understanding of various fields are better equipped to navigate these shifts, readily applying their knowledge to new challenges. For instance, a historian with a background in economics might be able to analyze the impact of historical events on contemporary economic trends, providing a unique perspective.
Moreover, a broad education encourages interdisciplinary thinking, leading to innovative solutions. By connecting ideas from different disciplines, individuals can develop novel approaches to complex problems. For example, a scientist with a background in philosophy might be able to approach ethical dilemmas in scientific research with greater nuance and insight.
In conclusion, while specialization can lead to mastery in a specific field, a broad knowledge base offers a more valuable foundation for success in the 21st century. It fosters adaptability, promotes interdisciplinary thinking, and prepares individuals for a world where knowledge is constantly evolving and interconnected. By embracing a diverse range of academic subjects, we cultivate intellectual flexibility and unlock the potential for innovative solutions to the challenges of our time.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, navigating social dynamics and forming meaningful relationships can be challenging. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find excitement in new experiences and adventures, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from quiet moments of reflection and appreciation for the simple things. For example, a young person might find joy in traveling to a new country, while an older person might find contentment in spending time with loved ones or pursuing hobbies. 

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that happiness is not a constant state. Both young and old individuals experience periods of joy and sorrow. While young people may have more opportunities for physical activities and social gatherings, older individuals may have a deeper understanding of life's complexities and a greater capacity for resilience. 

In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification. Both age groups experience a range of emotions and find happiness in different ways. It is essential to recognize the unique perspectives and experiences of individuals at all stages of life.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplification to assume that older individuals lack the capacity for joy and fulfillment.
Both stages of life offer unique experiences and opportunities for happiness, making a direct comparison unfair.
Young people often experience life with a sense of novelty and excitement. They are exploring new horizons, forging new relationships, and discovering their passions. This sense of discovery can be exhilarating, leading to a heightened sense of enjoyment. For example, the thrill of a first love, the satisfaction of achieving a personal goal, or the joy of traveling to a new place can be deeply fulfilling for young people.
However, older people have the advantage of accumulated wisdom and experience. They have weathered life's storms, learned from their mistakes, and developed a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. This perspective allows them to appreciate the simple pleasures in life, such as spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, and contributing to their communities.
For instance, a retired teacher who volunteers at a local library finds immense satisfaction in sharing their knowledge and helping others.
Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not solely determined by age. It is a matter of perspective, resilience, and the ability to find meaning and purpose in each stage of life. While young people may experience a different kind of joy, older individuals have a unique capacity for contentment and fulfillment. Both groups have the potential to live rich and meaningful lives, and it is unfair to suggest that one group enjoys life more than the other.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse and impactful ways in which they contribute.

Firstly, young people are increasingly active in social activism and advocacy. From organizing climate change protests to raising awareness about social justice issues, they utilize their voices and platforms to effect positive change. The recent surge in youth-led movements demonstrates their commitment to addressing pressing societal concerns.

Secondly, young people are actively involved in volunteer work. From serving meals at homeless shelters to tutoring underprivileged children, they contribute their time and skills to support those in need.

They are launching social enterprises, developing innovative solutions to local problems, and fostering a sense of community through collaborative projects. These initiatives demonstrate their commitment to building a better future for all.

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has been debated for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts across different disciplines.

By exploring different subjects, individuals discover new passions and interests, expanding their horizons and enriching their lives.

"I donnot agree to this statement becuse according to me having broad knowledge of many academic subject to specialize in one subject is just like jack of all and master of none.
I think if you are specialize in one subject , you will have more job oppurtunities,you will be preferred than other people who have knowledge of many subjects.
firstly,it is seen in many institutions ,they prefer masters for the higher post in their institutions becuse they have knowledge in depth by having lot of expossure and experience in same subject.
As seen in medical field also,that people prefer to go to a doctor who has the masters degree than a simple M.B.B.S. doctor.As you become specialized in one subject ,you have the knowledge in depth and in a proper way.
These are the reasons why i feel that having specialized in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects.",
"Forever young! This is what every of us want wants to be. As a young person life is easier and related with no problems. Young people seem to have more fun and enjoy life more than older people do. But is it really so? In the following essay I will to try figure out that older people can more enjoy their life!

I want to state that many young people are wasting a lot of their free time. They think they have to be ""cool"", hang around or just ""chill"". In that time they could do much more importand activities. The youngster are often of the opinion that they needn't to hurry up, becouse their whole life is in front of them. The older people act just opposite. They are aware of the fact that a large part of their life has past by, and they know that every minute is worth to enjoy. They try to plan a day as tought as it is possible, just to make the most of it. As an example you can take people, who needn't go to work anymore, because of their age. That persons have the whole day ""freetime"", but spend hardly a minute for rest. They went out for shopping, visit their families or spend time with friends. That people have gained a lot of experiece through their life. Cosequently they know that time is very costable and shouldn't be wasted. Todays youngster will also make that experience when they get older and older and will in future more enjoy their freetime. That""s the normal way of life!",
"Some people said that teenagers do not spend enough time on communities nowadays. I agree with it
First of all, the most important reson is that heavy burden of their studying. Especially in some Asian countries, young people should take part in a large number of  exercise classes and a great number of tests, so they spend a lot of time on their books. Some of them think it wasts time to take part in communities. If they spend more time on their communties, they will lack of time to prepare their tests. Futhermore, if they could not study in famous universities, they would not have a bright futhure even if they take part in some communities.
Second, young people have various kinds  of things need to do. For instance, it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope to independence. Many young people choose to do part-time job to earn more money and buy anything what they want.  They may feel tired  to take part in communities. Of course, some students hope to get more work experience and social experience on their free time. They think it is more useful than in communities. After they graduate, they are confidence in their interview because they have work experience in some companies.
Third, young people have many different kinds of entertainments,. such as Internet, Television. Some young people are reported to stay in front of computer all day and play games. They belives the computers bring more fun for their life. Some young people just like to go shopping. As a result, they are all lack of interests of taking part in communites,
In conclusion, I think there many reasons lead this result.it is a negative  phenomenon, so I suggest the society,  their parents and teachers should pay more attention on resolving this problem.",
"are not sleeping well these days. They say that it is becoming a harsher world. The development of technology resulted in isolation between families and neighboors. The younger generation is especially thought of as self-centered and unhelpful to their communities. Some facts might be true, but I disagree with the statement that the younger generation is unhelpful because young people spend a lot of time contributing to their communities by direct and indirect ways.

    The first reason I disagree with the statement is that young people actually do spend a lot of time helping out with the community.  For example, in my college, every freshman's dream is to join a student operated club to make school life more enjoying and plentiful. There are various choices of clubs, ranging from drama clubs to tea drinking clubs. However, out of the approximitly 100 clubs, one third of the clubs are volunteering clubs. Also, our school has a course that gives credit for volunteering during the semester. Eventhough the course is worth 1 credit, it is impossible to take the course because so many students apply for it. It may seem like young people are only interested in themselves, but given these reasons, I unquestionably believe that young people spend a considerate amount of time helping the community.
 
   Moreover, I disagree with the statement because the younger generation contribute to their communities not only directly, but in indirectly as well. Unlike the older generation, the younger people are exposed to advanced technology and globalization. In their own way their own way. For example, my country, Korea, is a small country. Recently, however, Korea has been expanding quickly  into the world. The reason is that young, smart people made succeses all over  the world. Because the represent our country, our country has a more succesful status in the world. 
   The younger generation may be a little more self-minded than the older people. However, that does not mean that they do not help their society. We are all contridbuting to our communities the way we can in our own unique ways. That is why our world is still a beautiful place to live.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a complex one. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When exposed to diverse subjects, individuals develop the ability to connect ideas from different fields, analyze information from multiple perspectives, and generate creative solutions. For example, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the social and economic factors that shaped historical events. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base promotes adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, skills are constantly evolving, and individuals need to be able to learn new things quickly and adapt to new situations. A broad education provides a foundation for lifelong learning and allows individuals to navigate the challenges of a dynamic environment. For instance, a person with a broad understanding of technology, business, and communication might be better equipped to transition between different careers or adapt to new technological advancements. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters empathy and understanding. Exposure to different cultures, perspectives, and disciplines broadens our horizons and helps us appreciate the complexities of the world. This understanding is crucial for building bridges between people, fostering collaboration, and creating a more inclusive and tolerant society. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is essential for critical thinking, adaptability, and empathy. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, individuals can become more well-rounded, adaptable, and engaged citizens, contributing to a more informed and interconnected world.",
"Generally speaking, I agree with the statement. In my opinion it has gotten harder for young people to get involved in community activity.
It is true that less an less young people participate in activities of their communities, but there are reasons to do so.
First of all, I think that the expectations of a young person's environment, especially parents and teachers, are very high nowadays. It is expected from a young person to earn good grades at school or at college, to participate in extra curricular activities to show a wide range of interest and many young people have to work after school to earn their spending money. There is not much time left to engage socially. 
Besides, in our society young people are told everywhere to have fun rather than being socially engaged. This raises young people's expectations as well. But I believe, that most young people cannot be held responsible for wanting to live like they are told to by the media and their environment. In other cultures young people do not experience the same kind of freedom young people in the USA have. Often they are told to take care of family members or friends, which is a social engagement as well. In the western civilisation the family structures and social connections have been weakened over the last decades, which might also be a reason for decreasing interest in social work.
So the problem of the declining number of young people who give time to help their community is overall a societal problem, that has to be dealt with, because there is still a necessity to encourage young people to engage socially.
Communites often depend on people, especially young ones, who are not paid for the work they do. Moreover, it can be a lot of fun, being an active part of a community. It is always a way to meet a lot of people who share your interests and it can be very inspiring to work with elderly people, for example.
Young people can lern a lot from them.",
"Nowadays generation is completely different of the older generation. In the older generation, young people, was more implicated in the environment benefits than today. They take more time to help their communities by extra jobs, by being more concerned of the pollution factors. Contrary to young people of nowadays, who primarily think for their own interest. For example, when you see people in the streets, and its wright that this problem touch more yougn people than older, they leave the duties in the street, sometimes they break down objects or furnitures of their communities. Moreover, young people, is less likely to participate to extra actions for the benefits of their communities, as for example, going to the religious place, helping the old people or at least your old neighborood who needs assistance, participating in beneficial actions or in humanitary actions,or whatever they can do and which could help to improve the situation of the communities. They could organize brunch, or collective entertainments but they think more of passing their time watching television or films, smocking with friends, going out the night or weaking up late. Young people are sometimes selfish and they take advantage more of their friendly life than from their family or community life. They are less interested of what possibilities they could offers to their community and environment. They have to give more of their own time to help and improve their communities.",
"I agree with this statement that ""young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.""  Since the society we live in has changed with time, people nowadays spend more time establishing their own affairs and therefore they are easily tended to ignore the needs of other people, and young people are no exception.  In fact, young people spend most of their time concerning about their studies, their future careers, and they might be too busy to give time to help their communities.
  Take Taiwan, my homecountry, as an example.  It is surely a very small island in the world, but meanwhile, there are still many people on this island.  The population density is astonishing.  Therefore, people here need to work or study hard in order to compete with others, and that might take them much time.  Young people in Taiwan need to worry about the school exams they are taking everyday and the future careers they are going to pursue.  They spend so much time at home studying or going to the cram schools that they only have little time for themselves, not to mention for their communities.
  What's more, people nowadays live more in apartments than in houses.  That is why they have fewer chances to communicate and interact with other people.  People living in apartments or mansions may not see the necessity of giving time to helping their communities or they may even think that there is no need for them to do so.  Indeed, it is nice to help the community, but not giving time to the community does not have any difference.  
  According to the reasons and examples I menioned above, I do agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites.  And that will remain as a current trend in the present time and also in the future.",
"My knowledge and my personal experience give me the reasons to  agree with the statement.
Second my knowledge because it's true  that the young people nowadays  do not give enough time to helping their communities because young people do not have time to do it.
In fact ,in the third millenium,the time is a very big and important source.This concept born principally  for the business world.The famous statement "" the time it is money"" confirm my opinion.
From the business people  to the young people nowadays there is a very small difference for  management time.
As a very business man,the child must employ his twenty-four hours: school ,sports and ...television!(social studies says that a child watch-in media- more of four hours of Television at day)
.Last but not least ,the friends.
Where is the time to give to helping communities? there is not!
Second my  personal experience I agree with the statement that says that toung people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
When I was I child I like give my time to helping my community,obviously second my personal skills.
Nowadays I am twenty five years old  and I have not got time for helping my communities.First because my work  do not give me more two  free hours at day.Second because I am married and I have got a son.I must help my wife in my free time!
However I like help my community and I hope to achieve it.
In my opinion the solution og the problem is in the manage of the time in particular of th efree time.",
"I do not agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Because I do not want to waste my money I earned to work hard and ask for quolity of products. Because the products I buy is related to my life. If goods is worse than they really are, it affect my life. 
          For example, I often purchase goods such as books or DVD on  the internet shop. However, I sometimes disapear goods  I bought because they are so old and dirty. So, I will not use them for a long time. 
         When I think of buying electical products, I need durable goods. So, if advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, I disapear and must change it soon. The other example, when I bought foods, it is bad taste and too expensive. 
           If i bought inferior goods, I waste monney I earned. I work hard everyday so I want to spend my money on my profit.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in community service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.


Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-ups to supporting local charities, they dedicate their time and energy to causes they believe in. For example, the recent rise of youth-led climate change activism shows a generation deeply concerned about the future of their communities and willing to take action.


Secondly, the digital age has opened up new avenues for community engagement. Social media platforms and online fundraising initiatives allow young people to connect with causes and contribute in ways that were previously inaccessible. They can raise awareness, mobilize support, and even donate financially to organizations working on issues they care about.


Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms.
Young people may not always be volunteering at soup kitchens or organizing charity events, but they contribute to their communities in other ways.
They may be mentoring younger children, advocating for social justice, or simply being good neighbors.
These acts of kindness and support, though seemingly small, have a significant impact on the well-being of their communities.


In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From traditional volunteer work to online activism and everyday acts of kindness, young people are actively shaping the world around them and demonstrating a commitment to making a difference.",
"In our consumptive society, advertising is a mean used by firms to sell their products. That is why they may sometimes made their products seem much better than they really are, but consumers have to be responsible..
	In fact, advertisement is the way to inform consumers about a new product. However, firms aim at making benefits and so, at selling most of their products. They use advertising as a way to sell them. That is why their products are embodied by glamourous and beautiful people. If we think a little about it, we can sell an ordinary product, whereas our concurrent same product is said to be miraculous or exceptionnal. For example, if we are the President of L'Oreal, we will not say that our make-up is just a good product, but we will hire Julia Roberts to represent our brain and to say that she can not live without it. That is how advertising works.
	However, we live in this consumptive society, for many years now and we are accustomed to these strategies. All consumers know that they do not often buy a real phenomenal product and they  have to be careful on these advertisements and not to believe everything told. Children and specially teenagers have to become aware of these dangers, or they will quickly spend all of their money. Many associations have been founded in France and in other countries to fight against advertising. They act in writting on all the advertisements located in the Metropolitan. Nobody knows how many they are, but they aim at stopping advertisment expansion.
	To conclude, I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, but consumers also have to be stronger than advertising power. Advertising is known for this particularity and we can't stop people to believe in this lies.",
"advertisements is one of the most important methods that the business use inorder to increase their profet and to help to create a very positive mind image in the customers mind to buy this product as soon as possible.
However there are so many ways to advertise the product ,such as producing posters and  creating a T.V commertial or sometimes by radio commertials ,in an addition small companies use the most affective and cheapest way in order to advertise the product to the people and that is by providing test samples of their production or by posting posters in the streets rather than creating a T.V comertial . 
Advertisements will affect the income of the business and will attrackt the customer to buy the product ,however not all products are perfict as they seem to be  because the company will onlly state the advantages and the good points about their production and they wont state the disadvantages of the product becasue the main goal of the company is sell as much products as they can in order to gain high profit . 
In an artical i once read they have found that the companies which they advertise their products befor selling it to the customers are likally to be succesfull and more garanteed to grow than the companies who sell their products without a pre-advertisements and without advertising the product to the people . 
Neverless in my point of view and according to my personal experiance i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ,however i do believe that the business should find that best ways to reach to the companies main goal that is to increase their profet by increasing their selling production and having as much customers as possible ,therefor adverising the product in a very positive image is one of the best ways to reach to their goal.",
"I don't agree at all with the idea that a young generally enjoys life more than older people do. We usually think about youth as a golden period of our life where we experience many unforgettable moments while we tend to consider the final period of our existence as the most painful one. Nevertheless we have to consider also the other side of the coin as a young person usually faces many difficulties an older person doesn't deal with anymore. 

There are in my opinion three different kinds of problems you face in when you are young.

First of all, everything is brand new to a you. You pass through a lot of experiences you don't know how to deal with because you lack the required experience about it. This often creates fears and doubts that is quite difficult to cope with unless you get the help of an older knowledgable person. For instance the doubts faced for the choice of a university, a crucial step in  life, can be lived in a very negative way and can create a big sense of lack of direction.

Secondly there are many situations that during your life you experience several times thus getting used to them. But when you are young and you experience these situations for the first time you are much more sensible to them than a older person would be. A typical example is love. A young person usually suffers much more than a older one because of love relationships because they are not yet used to them while getting older you acquire the experience that allows you to suffer less.

In the end, when you are young you don't know yourself very well since you are not aware of your strengths and weaknesses. This can cause a serious lack of self-confidence that creates very unpleasant feelings and thoughts in ayoung person. When you get older, instead, you are aware of your successed and failures and you get no more disappointed by them.",
"I remember an TV-ad about some kind of perfume which, once applied on your body, could bring you all the beautiful girls or boys that you may have dreamed of. I bought it and I can assure you that it does not work ! Maybe I was abused by the advertising but for sure,  but in my view the advertisement tends to overstate the main features of a product, and I will give the main reasons for that.

First, the main goal of an advertisement -and it is also the aim of marketing- is to promote a good or a service in order to increase its sales. As a consequence, the presentation of the product could not be fair in a sense. Indeed, I am quite certain that if a TV-ad shows the weakness of a good or service, in order to be partial, this good or service would be as appealing as the same presented by an ad which shows only the good aspects of it.

Second, advertisement tends to reach the imaginary part of our person to increase the attractiveness of products. By doing so, consumers are dreaming about such products and idolize them. For instance, you may have the strong desire to buy a luxury car because you have seen it on the TV and it was shown in an ideal place. Or you want to book your holidays in a pleasant place because you find the photographs you have seen very beautiful. But in fact the real situation could be, at least, normal.

As a conclusion, I do think that the advertisement does not provide a fair image of the products it supports. But it is worthwhile to mention that it depends on our own mind to distinguish between what it is true or not.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately reflect the qualities of a product, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image, often exaggerating its benefits and downplaying its limitations. This tendency to embellish reality is a pervasive strategy employed by advertisers to entice consumers, and it is a practice that I firmly believe distorts the true nature of products. 

One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals achieving remarkable transformations, while failing to mention the possible side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise. This selective portrayal creates an unrealistic expectation that the product will deliver miraculous results, which is rarely the case. 

Furthermore, advertisers frequently employ persuasive language and imagery to evoke emotional responses in consumers. They may use catchy slogans, celebrity endorsements, or visually appealing scenes to create a sense of desirability and urgency. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive decisions based on superficial impressions rather than rational assessments of the product's true value. 

In conclusion, while advertising plays a vital role in promoting products and services, it is essential to recognize that many advertisements are designed to create an idealized and often misleading perception of reality. By selectively presenting information, employing persuasive language, and appealing to emotions, advertisers can make products seem much better than they really are. As discerning consumers, we must be aware of these tactics and approach advertising with a critical eye, relying on our own judgment and research to make informed decisions.",
"I completely agree with what the statement asserts. I believe that nowadays students are more and more concerned with their own interests and less preoccupied for their nearby people's needs.
Students only want to go out with their friends, amuse themselves and have a life without preoccupations and resposabilities. On my opinion this is caused by a society that is getting more and more selfish and because parents and goverments are permiting it. We live in world where people want to get their necessities fulfilled and these ones are related more with personal and individual interests than with social interaction.

Personally, I think that people were more united before. They used to  help when it was necessary and they were taught to be attentive and co-operator with everybody. At the present time, students don't have these morals or ideals and they do not feel that they must help  their communities necessities. That students nowadays don't have enough time to carry out this kind of social labours it is not a reason, because students have never had so much time than ever. The problem is that tudents are getting more and more interested in playing videogames and other activities than helping their communities.

It also depends on the country you live. What I mean is that for instance, students don't have the same responsabilities and duties in Germany than in Spain. Spaniards don't have to accomplish any social labour like helping handicaps, invalids or aiding in government jobs like Germans do. I think every government should entice his students to carry out miscellaneous labors by making up to them in any aspect. What I mean is that if students don't feel the necessity or they just don't feel attracted to helping their communities the goverment should impose them a minimum social work requirement.",
"In the ever-evolving landscape of knowledge, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has been a subject of debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge base across multiple academic subjects is more beneficial in today's world. This is because it fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a holistic understanding of complex issues. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems from diverse perspectives. By understanding concepts from different disciplines, one can analyze situations with a wider lens, identifying connections and patterns that might be missed by a specialist. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics can better understand the social and economic factors that shaped historical events. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the world. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base makes individuals more adaptable to changing circumstances. In a rapidly evolving world, specialized skills can quickly become obsolete. However, individuals with a broad understanding of various subjects can readily adapt to new challenges and opportunities. For example, a graduate with a degree in literature might find themselves well-suited for a career in marketing or public relations, thanks to their strong communication and analytical skills. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters a holistic understanding of complex issues. In today's interconnected world, problems rarely exist in isolation. By understanding the interplay between different disciplines, individuals can develop more effective solutions. For instance, a scientist with knowledge of ethics and sociology can better navigate the ethical implications of scientific advancements. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in today's world. It promotes critical thinking, adaptability, and a holistic understanding of complex issues, making individuals better equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the nuances of human experience. While youth often possesses a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming that they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is an oversimplification. In fact, both age groups have unique advantages and challenges that contribute to their overall well-being. 

Young people, with their boundless energy and lack of commitments, are often able to pursue new experiences and explore their passions. The world feels full of possibilities, and the thrill of discovery fuels their enjoyment. For instance, a young traveler might find immense joy in backpacking across Europe, immersing themselves in new cultures and forging lasting memories. However, this freedom comes with its own set of anxieties and uncertainties. The pressure to succeed, the constant need to prove oneself, and the fear of making mistakes can weigh heavily on young minds. 

Older people, on the other hand, have often achieved a level of stability and security that allows them to focus on their passions and relationships. They have the wisdom gained from years of experience, which allows them to navigate life's challenges with greater resilience. For example, a retired artist might find immense satisfaction in finally having the time and resources to dedicate to their craft, creating masterpieces that reflect a lifetime of accumulated knowledge and skill. However, they may also face the challenges of declining health, the loss of loved ones, and the realization that time is finite. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that varies greatly from person to person, regardless of age. While youth may have a certain advantage in terms of physical energy and freedom, older people possess a depth of experience and wisdom that can contribute to a fulfilling life. Both age groups have their unique joys and challenges, and it is unfair to make sweeping generalizations about who enjoys life more.",
"The issue stated by the topic is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to be specialize in one specific subject.I belive that rather than having broad knowledge about many of our academic subject  it is more better to have more knowledge about the one we specialize in.I would prefer this because having a little knowledge on many academic subjects doesnt lead to success in our life.so it is better to specialize in  one major subject.
                 I will prefer to specialize in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academics because of the following reasons.The reasons will be that  now- a -days  most of the companies offering the jobs to the students who are more specailzed according to the requirements of the company ie.,companys are more intrested in the students who are ""specializers"".
            Another reason which dragged me to prefer to be specialized in one specific subject is that when we are trying to have broad knowledge about all the academic subjects we cant able to learn the basics in detail ie., we are not able get the overall inforamtion about the all the subject which turns to be  useless of learing all those.A famous english professor made a quote related to the above topic which says that "" we shouldn't be  jack of all and master of none "".This quote conveys that we are used to learn all the subjects in our academic years but masters of none of these subjects.many  famous scientists like newton,thomas alve edison doesnt had  a much broader knowledge but in fact they are specialized in thier own subjects which made them famous through out this world.
     Ultimately,i feel that it would be better to be specialized in one subject rather than having knowledge about all the academic subjects.",
"I think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necessary, it is the first step of a good education, a good foundation giving the best chances to adapt. But then it is often required to get a specialization.
In our society being specialized in one specific subject  is more and more a necessity, vital to get a job or to hold a position in a company. Also it helps to have a better salary.
It will often depend on the type of work or position. For example, lawyers should have broad knowledge of the legal system, the main legal principles and cases. But during their training, they are required to choose a specialization. Corporate lawyers should have a good practice and experience in Company Law. They cannot practice in Public Law and be good at it at the same time. These subjects are too different. The more they can get an experience in a specific area of Law, the best they will be in their area, the more they will be competent, recognised and well-paid.
The issue is the same for people working in Research or in the medical sector. After a certain number of years of study, a specialization is often mandatory for a certain number of jobs.
But the above mentioned statement can be exact for managers for example who should have a good knowledge of many areas of their companies in order to be able to take the right and appropriate decisions",
"Have you ever been on a bus when suddenly an old woman gets in it and nobody offered their seat? I guess that every one who has seen it, at least one time in their lives, will agree with me when I say that nowadays young people doesn't care about helping their community. Rigth now it is not a normal thing to help old people to cross the street, or to offer them your seat in the bus.

When I was at school, I used to go to the local hospital for working like a voluntier. I really loved! My dutties were to take care of some kids while the cleaners worked on their rooms. I spendt four hours a week playing with different kids. It wasn't a hard work for me, and it was a very usefull activitty for my community. I think everyone should try to help their communities, due to the fact that they will be able to have fun an at the same time make an excellent job to help other people.  Because all of this they may also feel better with themselves

However, what it's true is that in the 21th century's young people normally has a lot do. For example is pretty common for teenagers to work during the year, or to play different sports. Maybe those are the reasons, but maybe what happen is that young people is becoming very selfish. If they have time to hang out with their friends I 'm sure they can also find time to help their communities. Not to much time is requiered. You can make a lot with a\only a few hours a week.

In conclusion, nowadays young people don't give too much time to helping their communities, actually they do nothing for their communities, and this is very sad. I think schools should have kind of a subject to show kids how to help others and how to be involved in their communities.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This perspective stems from the inherent value of interdisciplinary thinking, the adaptability it fosters, and the enriched understanding of the world it provides.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows for interdisciplinary thinking, which is crucial in today's interconnected world. By understanding concepts from various fields, individuals can draw connections and develop innovative solutions to complex problems. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the social and economic factors that shaped historical events. This interdisciplinary approach fosters creativity and leads to breakthroughs that might not be possible within the confines of a single discipline.
Furthermore, a broad education equips individuals with greater adaptability in a rapidly changing world. The job market is constantly evolving, demanding professionals with diverse skills and the ability to learn new things quickly. A person with a broad knowledge base is more likely to adapt to these changes, as they possess a foundation of knowledge that can be applied to various situations. For example, a student with a background in literature, science, and history might be better equipped to transition into a career in data analysis or marketing, fields that require analytical thinking and communication skills.
Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches our understanding of the world and our place in it. By exploring different subjects, we gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things. We learn about different cultures, perspectives, and ways of thinking, which broadens our horizons and fosters empathy. This holistic understanding allows us to engage with the world in a more informed and meaningful way.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers invaluable benefits. It fosters interdisciplinary thinking, promotes adaptability, and enriches our understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of knowledge, we equip ourselves with the tools necessary to navigate the complexities of the 21st century and contribute meaningfully to society.",
"In our world are a lot of products and every day more products are created . They are very big differences between them. In my opinion most products could be been better as they are and the advertisments show us.

There are a lot of products, which are really good, like different kinds of water. On the other hand, there are a lot of products, which could be been better like jeans. I think that in the past the jeans had a better quality then now. For this there are some reasons. My first reason is that people buy cheaper jeans in lower quality and the big firms like Lewis had to get also cheaper prices, but on the other hand I think that the new designs had change the quality. There we can see the problem of the advertisments. They show us, the need of a new style, but they do not speak about lower quality. It decrease of cause of chemicals, which are need for the producing. An example are jeans in white color, because they were produced in blue and then the color is destroid.

An other example is perhaps that advertisments always have the best shower gel. I think that it was good for a log time, but every new product is a lot of better then the one before. I can not belive that it is possible to create every few month an other one, which is better than the one before. Furthermore they show us thinks, which make the product better, but it was always insite. 

I think that most products are good, but not so good, as advertisments show us. On the other site it is there job to show us that we have to spend money for new thinks. Normally that is a good way, because the firms have to spend money for there research and research is a very fundamental thing in our world.",
"People have different opinions on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Some people say that spacializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic. However , I oppose the idea for two reason . First, it allows  students to have diverse job's opportunities. Second, it is beneficial to choose the major.

To begin with, it enables students to get various job's opportunies. It is known that when students in university have diverst information about other fields exept for their own major, they can get a good job easily. Let me give my friend  for an example. One of the my best friends  has built  broad knowledge for a long time at an early age. So, he got better jobs than me . That is because he can have many options on jobs. If he would not have broad knowledge of many academic, he could not get  a job that he want to .

On top of that , it is beneficial to select the major . Today's many student in high school have a cercorn about their major in the university . That is due to the fact that they should have chosen the university . For example, my brother is in high school students. He has a worry about his major that he do in the university. So, his professor gives many advises for his major . Fortunitly, he can dicide his major that is art.

In conclusion, I agrees that students have broad knowledge of many academic as I mentioned avof",
"Yes,it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialisze in one specific subject because of various reasons.

If a person has knowledge about a particular subject,it is good.But if he wants to refrain himself from foraying from other subjects he should make sure that he is very thorough with that subject.Because finally he should find a job on that basis only and more ver all the academic topics are interconnected so, it imperative to have knowledgein various fields.

The above option would be good only if he find a job.He should always keep in mind the different possibilities in hi carreer.He should ask himself ""what if i dont get a job in his desired field of study?""

For example I am a mechanical engineering student.as every one knows there is a scarcity of jobs for mechanical engineers.if i continue with the same field would be left unemployed.Here I need to have an alternate option.I have my alternate option as computer sciences .I started learning some computer subjects.Now even if i donot get a job in my field of study, i may have a chance of getting it in field of computers.This would not leave me unemployed.I personally feel that being employed is better than being unemployed.

This criteria not ony works for two fields of same backround, it also works for a technical background and an arts background.For example, an electrical engineer who doesnot have a job and whose hobby is singing ,can survive by giving some stage shows .Which would also be considered as an employment.

Moreover ,broader knowlege would not leave you speechless when you are in a group.because when agroup is discussing a topic and  
if you are silent ,you may feel embarassed with that.But if you are familiar with the topic you can also give your opinion on the topic.this is possible only if you donat confine yourself to a particular field

I conclude that having a broad knowledge is better than to specialize in one subject.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has been debated for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.


Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When exposed to diverse subjects, individuals develop the ability to connect seemingly disparate ideas, analyze information from multiple perspectives, and generate creative solutions. For example, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the social and economic factors that led to historical events. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base promotes adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world.
In today's job market, employers seek individuals who can think critically, solve problems, and adapt to new situations. A broad education equips individuals with the skills and knowledge to navigate diverse fields and embrace new challenges. For instance, a graduate with a degree in literature might find success in fields like marketing or public relations, where strong communication and analytical skills are highly valued. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters a more informed and engaged citizenry.
Individuals with a diverse understanding of the world are better equipped to participate in meaningful discussions, make informed decisions, and contribute to the betterment of society.
For example, a citizen with knowledge of both science and politics can better understand the implications of scientific advancements on public policy. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and informed engagement, ultimately leading to a more well-rounded and successful individual and a more informed and engaged society.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to consider the complexities of human experience. While youth may bring a certain vibrancy and freedom, equating it with greater enjoyment is a simplistic view that overlooks the richness and fulfillment found in later years.


Firstly, youth is often associated with a sense of boundless possibility. Young people are less burdened by responsibilities and societal expectations, allowing them to explore their passions and experiment with new experiences. This sense of adventure and freedom can certainly contribute to a feeling of enjoyment. However, this freedom can also be overwhelming and lead to feelings of uncertainty and anxiety.


Conversely, older people have had the opportunity to cultivate deeper connections and build a sense of purpose. They have weathered life's storms and learned from their experiences, developing wisdom and resilience. This maturity allows them to appreciate the simple joys of life and find contentment in their relationships, accomplishments, and personal growth.


Furthermore, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. What brings joy to a young person, such as pursuing a new hobby or traveling to exotic destinations, may hold less appeal to someone who has already experienced these things. Older people may find greater satisfaction in quiet moments with loved ones, pursuing their passions, or contributing to their communities.


In conclusion, while youth may offer a unique set of opportunities and experiences, it is not a guarantee of greater enjoyment. Life is a journey, and the definition of enjoyment evolves as we age. Both young and older people have the potential to find fulfillment and joy in their own ways, depending on their individual circumstances and perspectives.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial.

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and adaptable learning experience. It fosters intellectual curiosity, encourages interdisciplinary thinking, and equips individuals with the skills necessary to navigate a complex and ever-changing world.

"There are a lot of people who think that young people enjoy life more than older people do.In my opinoin,I totally agree with this statement because the young have a more healthier body,also the world is new to them. 
We can not deny that the young have more healthier bodies which make they can enjoy their life much better.Nowadays there are many activities and sports for people to relax themselves such as the hiking,swimming.But these activities and sports have something in common,a good body.For example,the hiking request people being strong and full of energy.Even some young are not dare to try the hiking,so how could the older people?
Moreover,now many travels is not permitted to the people who have the heart diseases.As we know,it is a common diseases among the older.For example,once my family decided to go to Tibetan to have a journey,Unforturenatly my grand-father was not allowed to go there because of his heart diseases.
Many young people are curious to the new field than older people.Because the whole world seems to be new to him.There are a lot of food or sceneries they have never experienced before.But as to the older people,they are always stubborn and they do not listen to others' advices.When I asked my father to go to seaside,he always responced me that he was not willing to go.Because in his mind,the sea is no different although it is in the different areas and going to seaside would not appear him any more.But the young people never have this feeling.
All in all,from the reasons and example given above,we can easily draw the conclusion the young people enjoy life than older people do.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating one, filled with promises of enhanced lives and irresistible products. While some advertisements accurately depict the benefits of their offerings, it is undeniable that many exaggerate or even distort reality to entice consumers. This essay will argue that most advertisements indeed make products seem much better than they truly are, employing a variety of persuasive techniques to achieve this goal. 

One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is the creation of idealized scenarios. Commercials often feature flawless models using products in picturesque settings, implying that using these products will automatically lead to similar happiness and success. This is rarely the case in real life, as products rarely live up to the unrealistic expectations set by these advertisements. For example, a shampoo commercial might showcase a model with flowing, healthy hair, suggesting that the product will magically transform anyone's locks. In reality, hair type and condition vary greatly, and the shampoo's effectiveness may be limited. 

Furthermore, advertisers frequently employ emotional appeals to manipulate consumer desires. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or even fear, they create a sense of urgency and convince consumers that they need a particular product. For instance, a car advertisement might show a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that owning this car will bring them closer together and create lasting memories. This emotional connection can overshadow any rational consideration of the car's actual features and practicality. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of products, it is clear that many rely on exaggeration, unrealistic scenarios, and emotional manipulation to make products seem more desirable than they are. Consumers must be aware of these tactics and approach advertisements with a critical eye, focusing on the actual features and benefits of a product rather than the idealized image presented by the advertiser.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. Most advertisements, in my opinion, exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, creating an idealized image that often fails to match reality. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They focus on highlighting the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might emphasize its sleek design and advanced camera features, but it might fail to mention its battery life or the potential for software glitches. This selective presentation creates a distorted perception of the product, making it seem more desirable than it truly is. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and persuasive language to manipulate consumers. They use catchy slogans, celebrity endorsements, and evocative imagery to evoke feelings of desire, excitement, or even envy. These emotional triggers can cloud judgment and lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on superficial factors rather than rational considerations. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous model in a luxurious setting, suggesting that using the perfume will make the consumer feel equally sophisticated and desirable. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they are primarily designed to persuade and sell. By selectively presenting information, employing emotional appeals, and creating unrealistic expectations, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Consumers should be aware of these tactics and exercise critical thinking when evaluating advertising messages to avoid falling prey to exaggerated claims and unrealistic promises.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products and services. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of goods, I strongly disagree. Most advertisements, in my opinion, tend to exaggerate the benefits of products, creating an illusion of perfection that rarely matches reality. 

One compelling reason for this discrepancy lies in the inherent nature of advertising. Advertisers are primarily concerned with capturing attention and driving sales. To achieve this, they often employ persuasive techniques that embellish the truth. For instance, commercials for beauty products frequently showcase models with flawless skin and hair, using heavy makeup and digital enhancements to create an unrealistic standard of beauty. This deliberate distortion can mislead consumers into believing that the product will deliver miraculous results, when in reality, it may only offer marginal improvements. 

Furthermore, advertisements often focus on highlighting the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. Take, for example, advertisements for fast food chains. They typically feature mouthwatering images of burgers and fries, emphasizing the taste and convenience. However, they rarely mention the high calorie content, unhealthy ingredients, or potential health risks associated with frequent consumption. This selective presentation of information can lead consumers to make uninformed decisions that may have negative consequences for their health and well-being. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately portray the features of products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits and downplay their limitations. This deliberate manipulation of information can mislead consumers and create unrealistic expectations. Therefore, it is crucial to approach advertisements with a critical eye and to rely on independent sources of information before making purchasing decisions.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming they experience more joy is a generalization that overlooks the multifaceted nature of happiness. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves with age. Young people often prioritize immediate gratification, finding pleasure in social gatherings, new experiences, and physical activities. However, as individuals mature, their definition of enjoyment shifts towards deeper fulfillment. They may find satisfaction in personal growth, meaningful relationships, and contributing to society. 

Furthermore, older individuals have accumulated wisdom and resilience through years of life experiences. They have weathered storms and learned to appreciate the simple joys, finding contentment in quiet moments, family connections, and the satisfaction of achieving long-term goals. This perspective, often lacking in youth, allows for a more nuanced understanding of happiness.
Finally, the statement ignores the individual differences within both age groups. Some young people may struggle with anxieties, pressures, and uncertainties, while some older individuals may thrive in their later years, embracing new opportunities and passions. 

In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain energy and freedom, claiming they enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification.
Happiness is a complex and personal experience that evolves throughout life. Both young and old can find joy in their respective stages, and it is unfair to generalize about the relative levels of enjoyment based solely on age.",
"I disagree with the statement ' it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject' .In case of broad knowledge of many academic subjects we need to study all the subjects and become familiar with all the topics in the subject .It is difficult task to do .where as in case of the case of specialize in one specific subject is an easy process to know abt the subject.

	In specializing one specific subject, we can learn more about the topic and we can learn very deeply about the subject and become a gem in that particular subject.
	When a person go to a job he just sees that in which stream or subject  the candidate is more intelligent and the interviewer asks the quieries related to that subject only.Interviewer sees the candidate that how much deep knowledge the candidate has  in that subject.When we would like to do postgraduate courses we will be specizlized in a specific subject.
specializing one specific subject is a good and easy process.we can get deep knowledge in the subject and do some researsh works related to that subject.As an example if a person is  specialized in artificial intelligence, he can make many programs and make intellegen computer programs.He can write programs self.
 Borad knowledge of academic subjects is we should learn all the subjects in the academic year.we need to grasp all the topics which is big problem.It is very hard to graspe all the subjects and a tuff task to remember all the topics and points in the subject.We cannot be able to specialize in any field.It is difficult to understand each topic in the subjects and it takes much time to prepare all the subjects.
	It is not an easy task to have broad knowledge of academic subjects.
	broad knowledge of academic subjects is some what helpfull to shift to differernt streams and also different specializations.but we cany be perfect in any subject

	thus specialization in one specific subject is better an we can deepen knowledge .broad knowledge doesnt help and we will not be perfectrt in",

   THIRD AND THE MOST DRAMATIC ONE IS WE REALIZE THAT IT NOT AS GOOD AS IN THE ADVERTISEMENTS AFTER WE PAY LOTS OF MONEY FOR IT.

"The ubiquitous nature of advertising in our modern world leads many to believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products. While it is true that some advertisements employ deceptive tactics, I disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 

Firstly, the purpose of advertising is to attract consumers, and this often involves highlighting the positive aspects of a product. However, this does not necessarily equate to deception. For example, a car advertisement might emphasize the vehicle's fuel efficiency, safety features, and stylish design. While these features may be presented in a favorable light, they are not inherently false. Consumers are still able to research and compare different models before making a purchase.
Secondly, many advertisements are regulated by government agencies and industry standards. These regulations aim to prevent misleading or deceptive advertising practices. While some companies may still attempt to push the boundaries, the existence of these regulations helps to ensure that most advertisements are truthful and accurate.
Finally, consumers are becoming increasingly savvy and discerning. With access to a wealth of information online, consumers can easily research products, read reviews, and compare prices. This empowers consumers to make informed decisions and avoid products that are falsely advertised.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may exaggerate the qualities of products, it is inaccurate to claim that most advertisements do so. The purpose of advertising is to attract consumers, and this often involves highlighting positive aspects. However, regulations and consumer awareness help to ensure that most advertisements are truthful and accurate. Consumers have the ability to research and make informed decisions based on their own needs and preferences.",
"I personally agree with the topic that nowadays young people donot  give enough time to helping their community.

Students in the present day modernised world are attracted to more of things like discos and pubs rather than social activities. To make my opinion stronger i would like to take a personel experience.On the eve of The Independence Day some of our college friends decided to do some thing good on that day.As a part of it we decide to constuct a compound wall for a tribal school.We sent requests to different colleges in need of volunteers.But on that we were shocked to see that vrey few people turned out for that event.

One more reason why stuudents cant make to such events is that the world has become so competetive that students dont even get time to relax for one complete day.For example my friends who are persueing thier graduate courses also aim for other exams like CAT,SAT etc.Also they need to maintain their grades in thier regular graduetion course.So its difficult for them to spend some time for the extracurricular activities.Thus howmuch interest they have its not possible for students like them.

Finally the advent of internet in the 20th century revolutionised things very much.It has made world into a global village.Anyone can access anything in this world by just sitting at their homes.This made young people from moving out of their places.Thus making them lazy.Hence seldom young people spare enough time to helping thier communities.

 Thus from my personal experience i think that young people
nowadays donot give enough time to helping thier communities.",
"I would like to discuss the statement that young people do not spend enough time to help and suopport the community they are living in.

To my mind young people nowadays spend less time helping their communities than they did some decades ago but you should consider that there are quite a lot of things that have dramatically changed over the past few years. Now, there are many new services offered by the government that give us the opportunity to spend our time doing something else than working for our community. An example for this would be the improved helthcare system: Some time ago, it was nearly impossible to work in full-time job if one of your relatives was very ill and needed permanent care and help. Today, you just have to apply for special services that are paid by the insurance and you will be given help.

However, there are still some some services which cannot be provided and / or paid by the community. In those cases (i.e staff at the fire brigades, ambulance drivers, trainers at sports clubs etc.) there is indeed kind of a shortage. In my free time, I am working as an ambulance driver without being paid for this. Often have I experieced situations in which we ran out of personnel because nobody wanted to work on the weekend or wanted to stay up all night. I wish that in those cases, more people would recognize how important their contribution would be.

All in all, I think that we do indeed need a young generation that spends more time helping their communities than many people do now, but we only need their support in some fields. So my suggestion would be to try to make some advertisement and promotion in order to show them how much fun it can be to play an active role in society and to help them to find the right kind of occupation for them.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific subject has been a long-standing debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual flexibility, promotes interdisciplinary thinking, and equips individuals with a more comprehensive understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts from different disciplines, leading to innovative solutions and perspectives. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might analyze historical events through the lens of economic factors, uncovering new insights. This interdisciplinary approach is crucial in today's complex world, where problems often require multifaceted solutions.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates intellectual flexibility and adaptability. In a rapidly changing world, individuals with specialized knowledge may find their skills becoming obsolete. However, those with a broad understanding of various subjects can readily adapt to new challenges and opportunities. For example, a student with a background in literature, philosophy, and science might be better equipped to navigate the complexities of the digital age than someone solely focused on a single field.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters interdisciplinary thinking, promotes intellectual flexibility, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of academic subjects, individuals can become more adaptable, innovative, and well-rounded thinkers, ultimately contributing more effectively to society.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has been debated for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a well-rounded education fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems from multiple perspectives. By studying diverse subjects, students develop a framework for analyzing information, identifying patterns, and drawing logical conclusions. For instance, a student who has studied both history and economics can better understand the complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors that shape historical events. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the world. 

Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals who are versatile and able to learn new skills quickly. A student with a broad knowledge base is more likely to adapt to new challenges and thrive in different environments. For example, a student with a background in literature, science, and technology can easily transition between different fields and contribute to diverse projects. 

Finally, a broad education cultivates a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge. By exploring different disciplines, students gain a holistic understanding of how various fields of study interact and influence one another. This interconnectedness allows for a more comprehensive and meaningful understanding of the world. For instance, studying both art and science can reveal the underlying principles of beauty and order that govern both the natural and the human-made worlds. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge, preparing individuals for a successful and fulfilling life in a complex and ever-changing world.",

Having a diverse understanding of various subjects allows individuals to readily transition between fields, explore new opportunities, and remain relevant in a dynamic job market. For instance, a person with a broad background in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) might be better equipped to navigate the complexities of the digital age than someone solely focused on a single STEM discipline. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking skills. By exposing oneself to different perspectives and disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify biases, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking is essential for navigating the complexities of modern life, from evaluating news sources to making informed decisions about personal and societal issues. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base allows for a more holistic understanding of the world. By connecting different subjects and disciplines, individuals can see the interconnectedness of various phenomena and develop a more comprehensive view of the world. For example, understanding the historical context of a scientific discovery can provide a deeper appreciation of its significance, while exploring the ethical implications of technological advancements can lead to more responsible innovation.

"No I dont agree, because for every item there should be a   different way  in advertising it.
                       If you want to advertise for Rolex watch for example   let's say that you will do an advertising for woman that goes to party and wearing a very exepensive watch which is Rolex and in the party all of the people see the watch and they come to talk to her just to see   the watch and they respect her more because of wearing that watch.And thats not a lie because if the person wearing a Rolex watch means that he is from  high class of people and offcourse everyone  will respect that kind of people.
                              Another type of advertising is to  advertise for simple doll you may say that in television they make the doll more intersting because they develops something in the advertisment and that develops doesnt occur when  you buy the doll and you get bored of it after two days but really it depends on your imagination, in the advertisment they really develops something but you can also develop something to do it with the doll its really depends on  your imagination and if you have a sharp imagination you can keep playing with doll for ever and not get bored.
                             Also in Galaxy choclate advertising they show you that when  women eats a bar of Galaxy choclate they  becomes sensitves and show sensitives motion and you may say that it is a lie
but really when you eat a Galaxy choclate you fell a different delicous taste which let your minds feel relax ,  not like other faked choclates that have been made in east of  asia or any other places and seriously when eat a bar of it, your minds get uncomfortable and you become little bit angry and thats only beacuse of the bad taste of choclates.

              Older people are not so energitic as young blood ,because of the age factor ,not flexible body as age grows and responsibilities they have around them.They cannot enjoy the same  one as, the zeal with which   young people do.Because they are always cornered with the problems and responsibilities  that surround around them.

At the mourning age we like to spend a lots of time with friends,roaming on bikes and attending parties and functions to get the time passed and the joyful and delightful mood.At this age we spend lavishly and even and we do not even known how to control our activities.

"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and amplifying their impact. For instance, the recent surge in online activism surrounding environmental issues demonstrates the power of young people to advocate for change through digital platforms. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work and community organizations. From volunteering at local soup kitchens and animal shelters to participating in environmental clean-up drives and mentoring programs, they are actively contributing to the well-being of their communities. Many schools and universities also encourage community service, providing opportunities for students to gain valuable experience and make a difference. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms. Young people may not always engage in traditional volunteer activities, but they contribute to their communities in other ways. For example, starting a local business, organizing community events, or simply being a good neighbor can all be considered forms of community service. These actions, while seemingly small, can have a significant impact on the lives of others. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people's involvement in community service, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, young people are actively engaged in making a positive difference in their communities. By recognizing and appreciating their efforts, we can foster a culture of civic engagement and empower them to continue making a meaningful impact.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless young individuals are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, they dedicate their time and energy to causes they believe in. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led climate change activism showcases their commitment to addressing global issues. These young activists organize protests, raise awareness, and advocate for policy changes, demonstrating a profound dedication to their communities. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to create positive change. Many are using their technological expertise to develop innovative solutions for social problems. For example, young entrepreneurs are creating businesses that address poverty, hunger, or environmental degradation. Their entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to social impact are transforming communities and inspiring others to get involved. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From volunteering to social entrepreneurship, young people are actively engaged in making a difference. Their dedication and commitment to creating a better world should be acknowledged and celebrated.",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a topic of much debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is more advantageous in the long run. This is because a well-rounded education fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In a world where industries are constantly evolving and new technologies emerge, having a diverse range of skills and knowledge allows individuals to seamlessly transition between fields. For instance, a student with a broad background in humanities and sciences might be better equipped to navigate the complexities of the tech industry than someone with a narrow specialization. 

Secondly, a broad education encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By exposing individuals to different perspectives and disciplines, it fosters the ability to analyze information from multiple angles and develop creative solutions. For example, a historian studying economics might gain a unique perspective on the causes of economic crises, drawing upon historical precedents and social factors. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to see the interconnectedness of knowledge. By understanding how different subjects relate to each other, individuals can develop a more holistic understanding of the world. For example, a student studying literature might gain a deeper appreciation for the social and political context in which a particular work was written.

In a world characterized by constant change and complexity, a well-rounded education is essential for navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception, often fueled by romanticized views of youth. While it's true that young people may experience a certain vibrancy and freedom, equating this to greater enjoyment is a simplification.
Both young and old individuals have their unique advantages and challenges, leading to varying experiences of life's joys. 

Firstly, young people often possess a sense of boundless possibility. They are less burdened by responsibilities and expectations, allowing them to explore new experiences and pursue their passions with greater freedom. This sense of adventure can undoubtedly contribute to a feeling of enjoyment. However, this freedom can also be a double-edged sword, leading to uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Older individuals, on the other hand, may have a more stable foundation, but they also possess a wealth of experience and wisdom that can bring a different kind of fulfillment. 

Secondly, older people often have a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life. They have witnessed both the highs and lows of life, and this perspective allows them to savor the small moments of joy.
For example, a retired teacher may find immense satisfaction in spending time with their grandchildren, something they might not have fully appreciated during their busy working years.
While young people may prioritize excitement and novelty, older individuals often find joy in the familiar and the meaningful connections they have cultivated over time. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with a certain carefree spirit, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. Both young and older individuals experience life's joys in different ways, and it is ultimately a matter of perspective and individual experiences.
Enjoyment is not a competition, but rather a personal journey that evolves and deepens with time.",
"Have you ever noticed how young people enjoy their life and how older people do in this twenty first century? I agree that every person contains his/her own style of how to enjoy life. It is not a matter of age. Different stages of life bring different patterns of how to do it. In this eassay I wil  explain in a positive manner both how young and older people could live their own life regardless of age.
Firstly, young people usually love to enjoy their life intensently. For example, once the  turn 18 years old, which is the legal age in order for them to get indenpendent, they like to go out with their friends, and dance all night (if it is possible). In addition, they could get their driver license exam, by doing this they will be able to buy their own car, which also make them feel more independent. Moreover, they may be healthy sufficient in order for them to join different type of sports, that really require  to be in optimal  health condition.
Secondly, older people have their unique way of enjoying their own life. For instance, there is a certain age that an old person love to make some planns.  A 65 years old couples, will enjoy to be in a quite envirement while they are having a romatic dinner. If they plann to  celebrate every marriage anniversary, they will choose a restful hotel where they would not be disturbed by any type of noise. On the other hand, a young person will look for another type of envirament. Furthermore, older people will not have a good health condition, which will limit them to be more creative. However they will still enjoy form several activities that do not require them to be that healthy. For example, they could spend time swimming, playing golf, and playing cards.
In conclusion, I am strongly conviced that the age does not affect how people could enjoy their life. There is multiple manners of how to do this. Even though not every person has a healthy condition, there is always a way of how to enjoy a life.",
"We always heard that the young people are too lazy, that they spend too much time im front of their computer screens, chatting or playing video gamesand that they always refuse to work at home a
       I think those who said these words must have a look to all the activities the young people do to help the community before having such as this opinion. 

      The first thing we should notice is that the youth is the synonym of art, creativity and imagination. Most of the teenagers are interested in urban art, music or at least cinema. When they go outside to the cinema or to a concert, they are directly involved in the artistic life.
A lot of teenagers play a music instrument, sing or play theater. It's an efficient way to devellop art,  to improve the artistic production. 
     For instance, walls graffittis were considered few decades ago such as a teenager's occupation without any artistic value. However, they are considered nowadays like real artistic paintings of this original urban art. Rqp music music was considered also as a '' bad'' music but it becomes nowadays a real art.
   In fact, we can see that the young people helped their communities to improve their qrtistic skills and to create new ones. In other words, they don't lose their time whem they are listening to their own type of music or when they are drawing their specific draws.

     Besides, we can add that the young help the society to improve its organization because they are the first one's who react when something wrong happen. If the government takes decisions which go against the citizens, youth will be the first one who will be on strike to defend all the citizens rights and the values that they believe in.
    For instance, when the French governement took a decision which made workers' situation more impredictable, the young student went out in the street to demonstraste that this law went again their values. this example shows that the young take time to defend the rights of the community whem they see that the society is in danger.

Finally, we can see that young people denfnd their rights and devellop  the artistic activity. They are not as lazy as is generally said.",
"I agree that  most advertisment make products seem much better that they really are. yes they do, by hiring big celebreties and well known atleths  by showing something els and selling something els

Most companies  like to hire some well known persons that they know the public like for their adverts just to make money. Because  they know that when the public sees the face their products will sale, so they will pay them a big sum, and sell something different to the masses. for example the clothing companies they hire a big name to advertise there  products, but they sell something different though the  public don't care becaue they wearing the cluth because of the face of the star on the cloth.
    I  bought a kelvin clean  jean, it's a big name in clothing business and i bought because of the big name. but it did not last  for me as i thought it was going to last the first time i washed it the colour changed authomatically. the same with the cosmetic companies they will tell you  to try there product and your face will be as smooth as you want it to be. these are just market stratefies .they just want to sell there product. 
      Also the phone companies they will make you to switch to there network it is the best on the long run you will come to realise it's the same every where.And the worst is the credit card company they use there advertisment to lure you in and give a different service and you end up owning them for life.

Haven seen all these reasons and example I think it is very clear that not all the advertiment  is good because they seem much better than the service they will offer you. So I  agree that most advertisment is much better than the products.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a sweeping generalization that overlooks the diverse ways in which young individuals contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, a significant number of young people actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of social responsibility.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local clean-up drives to advocating for environmental sustainability, young people are taking the lead in addressing pressing issues. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, exemplifies their commitment to creating positive change.

Furthermore, many young people dedicate their time and energy to volunteering. They work with organizations that support the elderly, mentor underprivileged children, or provide assistance to those affected by natural disasters. These actions demonstrate a genuine desire to make a difference and contribute to the well-being of their communities.
While it's important to acknowledge that some young people may not actively participate in community service, it's unfair to paint an entire generation with the same brush. The reality is that young people are diverse, and many are actively contributing to their communities in meaningful ways. Their dedication and passion for making a difference should be recognized and celebrated.",
"I agree with the statement that ''most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are''.Usually the products in the advertisements are shown to be more good looking,elegant,tasty,good texture,and all the higher qualities, for which most of the times they don't possess all those qualities.
             For example take an advertisement of suiting's and shirtings,the dress they show seems to be very beautiful and attractive,elegantly coloured, but the same when you see truely may not be so good,the stiching may not be so perfect ,the colour shades may not be appropriate and it may not fit well.
             The other example, if we take the advertisements regarding the food products ,they show them to be very tasty and delicious and they also shows that they can be prepared within few minutes,but actually when we really taste them they may not be that delicious,or it may even take long time for preparing it.
              Even the advertisements on variuos medical products show that the medicine works really faster ,in a more efficient way,and they show all the things that make us appeal that the product is of superior quality,but in real they may be associated with various side effects and may act differently on different individuals or even the costs may be higher.
                  For example once i was watching an advertisement over the television which was an equipment use for reducing weight.The advertisement said that we got to workout only for 15minutes on that equipment and no diet necessary and it would make you lose about 5 pounds per week,and even they were showing some of the people and their experiences who used that product and by looking at all those i was so tempted to buy the product and ordered it,but once when i got the product and started using for few days,i couldn't see any lose in  my weight but i also notice knee pain problems by using that equipment.So,with that i clearly came to know that never beleive in advertisements as they usually make the products seem better that they really are to increase their sales.
                  So,atlast I strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better as, that this the primary job of advertising in order to increase their sales and benefits,and it's our duty to carefully judge the true characteristics of the product and decide whether to buy or not.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's academic horizons is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having broad knowledge across multiple subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a well-rounded education fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge.


Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems from diverse perspectives. By understanding concepts from different disciplines, one can analyze situations more comprehensively and identify solutions that might not be apparent within a narrow field. For instance, a historian studying the rise of fascism might benefit from understanding economic principles to analyze the social and political factors that contributed to its emergence.


Secondly, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. As technology advances and new challenges arise, individuals with a diverse range of knowledge are better equipped to navigate these changes. They can readily transfer their skills and knowledge to new fields, making them more employable and adaptable to the demands of the modern workforce.


Finally, a broad education cultivates a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain a greater understanding of how various disciplines interact and influence each other. This holistic perspective allows for a more nuanced and informed understanding of complex issues, fostering a sense of intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning.


In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad education offers invaluable benefits. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge, ultimately preparing individuals for a fulfilling and successful life in a complex and ever-changing world.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a fallacy to assume that older individuals lack the capacity for joy and fulfillment. In fact, life experiences, wisdom, and a deeper understanding of oneself can contribute to a richer and more meaningful existence in later years. 

Firstly, older people have the advantage of accumulated life experiences. They have witnessed triumphs and tribulations, learned from mistakes, and developed a nuanced perspective on the world. This wealth of knowledge allows them to appreciate the present moment more fully, recognizing the preciousness of each day. For instance, a retired teacher who has dedicated their life to educating young minds might find immense satisfaction in spending time with their grandchildren, sharing their wisdom and creating lasting memories. 

Secondly, older individuals often prioritize their well-being and pursue activities that bring them genuine joy. They have the freedom to explore their passions, whether it be travel, art, or volunteering. This newfound autonomy allows them to live life on their own terms, free from the pressures and expectations of youth. A retired musician, for example, might finally have the time and resources to compose and perform their own music, fulfilling a lifelong dream. 

In conclusion, while youth may be characterized by a certain exuberance, it is inaccurate to suggest that older people do not enjoy life. With age comes a deeper understanding of oneself, a greater appreciation for the present moment, and the freedom to pursue passions. The joy and fulfillment experienced in later years can be just as profound, if not more so, than those of youth.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute to their communities. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits over communal involvement, countless others actively engage in various forms of service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-ups to tutoring programs, youth are dedicating their time and skills to address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change initiatives showcases their commitment to creating a sustainable future. These young activists organize protests, raise awareness, and advocate for policy changes, demonstrating a deep concern for their communities. 

Secondly, the digital age has opened up new avenues for community engagement. Social media platforms and online fundraising campaigns allow young people to connect with causes they care about and mobilize support from a wider audience. For example, online petitions and social media campaigns have successfully raised awareness and funds for various social justice movements, showcasing the power of youth activism in the digital realm. 

In conclusion, while some young people may not actively participate in traditional forms of community service, it is unfair to generalize that they lack a sense of civic responsibility. The diverse ways in which youth contribute to their communities, both online and offline, demonstrate their commitment to making a positive impact. It is crucial to recognize and appreciate the various forms of engagement that young people undertake, rather than dismissing their contributions as insufficient.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a wide spectrum of emotions and life experiences, making it impossible to definitively declare one group as inherently happier than the other. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment of life. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming, leading to stress and uncertainty. Moreover, the social pressures of fitting in and navigating complex relationships can add to the emotional burden of youth. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a greater sense of stability and fulfillment, having navigated the challenges of life and established a strong foundation for themselves. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. What brings joy to a young person may not hold the same appeal to an older individual. For instance, a teenager might find immense satisfaction in attending a concert or spending time with friends, while an older person might derive more pleasure from quiet evenings at home, pursuing hobbies, or spending time with family. The definition of enjoyment is fluid and personal, making it difficult to generalize across age groups. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with certain advantages, such as physical vitality and a sense of possibility, it is inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. Both age groups experience a unique set of joys and challenges, and the perception of enjoyment is subjective and evolves over time. Ultimately, happiness is not solely determined by age but rather by individual circumstances, perspectives, and values.",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a highly debated topic. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is more advantageous in the long run. This is because a diverse understanding fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a holistic perspective. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In a world where industries and technologies are constantly shifting, having a diverse range of skills and knowledge makes one more resilient. For instance, a person with a strong background in humanities, science, and technology can easily transition between different careers, even in fields that are seemingly unrelated. This adaptability is crucial for navigating the uncertainties of the modern job market. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By understanding different perspectives and disciplines, individuals can approach challenges from a more holistic viewpoint. They can draw connections and insights from various fields, leading to innovative solutions. For example, a historian with knowledge of economics might be able to analyze historical events in a more nuanced way, understanding the underlying economic factors that contributed to them. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters a sense of interconnectedness and a deeper understanding of the world. It allows individuals to appreciate the complexities of different cultures, societies, and disciplines. This holistic perspective is essential for effective communication, collaboration, and navigating the diverse challenges of the 21st century. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in the long run. It promotes adaptability, critical thinking, and a holistic understanding of the world, which are essential for success in today's dynamic environment.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate and embellish, making products seem far better than they truly are. This tendency is driven by the desire to entice consumers and boost sales, often at the expense of honesty and realism. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss supplement might showcase a slim and toned individual, implying that the product is the sole reason for their transformation. However, the advertisement may fail to mention the rigorous exercise regimen and healthy diet that the individual also follows. This selective presentation creates a misleading impression of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisers often utilize persuasive language and imagery to evoke emotions and desires in consumers. A car advertisement might feature a sleek, luxurious vehicle speeding down a scenic highway, suggesting a sense of freedom and excitement. However, the reality is that the car may be expensive to maintain and not as fuel-efficient as advertised. By appealing to our emotions, advertisers can make products seem more desirable than they actually are. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority tend to exaggerate and embellish the qualities of products. By selectively presenting information, using persuasive language, and appealing to our emotions, advertisers create a distorted perception of reality. As consumers, it is crucial to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",

"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions and influencing our purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the benefits and qualities of goods, making them appear far superior to their actual nature. This essay will explore the reasons behind this phenomenon, using specific examples to illustrate my point.

Firstly, advertisements often employ persuasive language and imagery to create an idealized version of reality. They use evocative words like ""luxurious,"" ""revolutionary,"" and ""unbeatable"" to evoke positive emotions and associations with the product. For instance, a shampoo advertisement might depict a model with flowing, lustrous hair, implying that using the product will transform one's hair into a similar state. However, in reality, the product may only offer minimal benefits, and the model's hair is likely enhanced through professional styling and editing.

Secondly, advertisements frequently focus on highlighting the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. A car advertisement might showcase its sleek design and powerful engine, but it may fail to mention its poor fuel efficiency or high maintenance costs. Similarly, a fast-food commercial might emphasize the deliciousness of its burgers, but it may not disclose the high calorie content or the use of artificial ingredients.

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on misleading claims and testimonials. They may use celebrities or experts to endorse products, even if they have no genuine experience or knowledge of them. For example, a weight-loss supplement might feature a celebrity who claims to have achieved remarkable results using the product, but this claim may be fabricated or exaggerated. Such tactics can deceive consumers into believing that the product is more effective than it truly is.

In conclusion, while some advertisements may present accurate information, the majority tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products to entice consumers. By using persuasive language, highlighting positive aspects, and employing misleading claims, advertisements create an idealized image of products that often fails to reflect reality. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be discerning and critical when evaluating advertising messages to avoid being misled by their deceptive tactics.",
"SOMEONE HAS RIGHTLY SAID:
""LIFE IS AN ICE CREAM, EAT IT BEFORE IT MELTS!!""

THE TOPIC THAT WHETHER YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE IS REALLY A VERY INTERESTING ONE, MAKING SOMEONE TO THINK REAL DEEP ABOUT IT. 'ENJOYMENT' IS ONE FACTOR IN LIFE WHICH IS NOT RELATED TO AGE. I THINK ONE ENJOYS LIFE WITH HEART. BUT, AGE FACTOR DO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE TYPE AND LEVEL OF ENJOYMENT ONE CAN HAVE AND NO DOUBT  YOUNG PEOPLE ARE AT AN ADVANTAGE AT THIS.

FIRSTY, THE ZEST & ZEAL WITH WHICH A TEENAGE OR AN ADULT WILL ENJOY DOING AN ACTIVITY, AN OLDER PERSON WILLN'T BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE SAME ENERGY LEVEL. HE WILL GET EASILY FATIGUED & LOOSE HIS INTERSET SOON . FOR INSTANCE, ON MY BIRTHDAY PARTY, WE YOUNGESTERS HADE MUCH FUN DANCING & PLAYING GAMES. BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, MY GRANDPARENTS COULDN'T ENJOY THAT MUCH. THEY WERE REALLY TIRED AND WENT OFF TO SLEEP SOON.

SECONDLY, THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS MORE ADVENTERIOUS &  LIKE TO DISCOVER AND EXPLORE  NEW IDEAS,THINGS & PLACES. WHEREAS, AGED PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE AND NOW THEY  WANT TO ENJOY  REST OF THEIR LIFE PEACEFULLY. 

LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, YOUNG MINDS ARE MORE TENSION FREE AS THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY PRESSURE OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITIES. THE CHILD IN THEM ALWAYS LOOKS FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY LIKE GOING FOR A PICNIC, RESTAURANT OR A MOVIE. WHEREAS, THE PRESSURE OF RESPONSIBILITIES SHOULDERED UPON THE OLDER PEOPLE LIMITS THE CHILD WITHIN THEM FROM DOING  ALL THESE THINGS.

TO CONCLUDE, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT BOTH YOUGER & OLDER PEOPLE ENJOY THEIR LIVES IN THEIR OWN DIFFERNT WAYS. WHILE,  FUN, EXCITEMNET, PARTIES, DANCE & MUSIC MEANS THE WAY TO LIVE LIFE FOR YOUNGESTERS; 
PEACE, CALMNESS, CHERISHING OLD MEMORIES, MEANS ENJOYMENT TO THE OLD PEOPLE!!",
"I disagree that statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for several reasons. 
     First, when we buy something in the store, we almost read the advertisement about that we are going to buy. Then we decide if we should buy or not. If the advertisement about that we are going to buy is good for us, we may buy that. Wether we buy something or not is depends on advertisement, so they should not tell a lie.
     Second, if advertisements use the information that seem much better than they really are, and consumers buy and use that stuff, it can be harmful for consumers. For example, if advertisements say that this meal doesn't include fat at all although it really include much fat, those who buy that and have regurally can get fat. It is not good for health.
     Finally, if most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are, consumers can't believe them and buy anything. It is serious problem. For human can live safety and confortable, advertisements should be honest, I think. 
     For these reasons, I think most advertisements should not make produsts seem much better than they really are.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various avenues. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change activism, exemplified by Greta Thunberg's movement, showcases the passion and dedication of young people in tackling global challenges. These individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices to advocate for change, demonstrating a deep sense of responsibility towards their communities. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to create positive change. Many young entrepreneurs are launching businesses with a social mission, aiming to address specific needs within their communities. For example, the growing popularity of social enterprises focused on sustainable practices and poverty alleviation highlights the innovative spirit of young people who are committed to making a difference. By combining their entrepreneurial drive with a social conscience, they are contributing to the well-being of their communities in tangible ways. 

In conclusion, while it may be tempting to paint a picture of young people as apathetic towards community service, the reality is far more nuanced. Young people are actively engaged in various forms of community involvement, demonstrating their commitment through volunteer work, social entrepreneurship, and advocacy. Their dedication to making a positive impact on their communities is a testament to their generation's desire to create a better future for all.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibilities, equating this to a greater enjoyment of life is a simplistic view. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person.
What brings joy to a young person, like exploring new experiences or pursuing romantic relationships, may not hold the same appeal to an older individual who values stability and contentment.
For example, a seasoned artist might find more satisfaction in perfecting their craft than a teenager who is just starting to experiment with different mediums.
Secondly, the enjoyment of life is often intertwined with personal circumstances and life experiences.
A young person may be experiencing the thrill of newfound independence, while an older person may be grappling with the challenges of aging or the loss of loved ones.
The joy of a young person's first job may be overshadowed by the anxieties of financial insecurity, while an older person may find solace in the wisdom and perspective gained through years of living.
Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a personal journey that evolves throughout our lifespan.
To claim that one age group enjoys life more than another is to disregard the unique experiences and perspectives that each stage of life offers.
While youth may possess a certain energy and optimism, older individuals often develop a deeper appreciation for the simple pleasures and the beauty of life's journey.
Therefore, it is inaccurate to suggest that young people enjoy life more than older people.",
"Having a broader knowlege of many academic subjects helps a person to have a wider information of the things present in the vast world that he is lives in. It keeps him aware of the facts and helps him deal with problems with a wider perspection. 
On the contrary, specializing in one subject on a particular area keeps him localized and makes him narrow minded. Furthermore, it makes him lose the self confidence while dealing with situations that come to him unexpectedly. He feels enclosed and lost in this world of varieties.
For instance, I have a friend whose mother is a teacher and has studied History, Geography and English. When I see her deal with the problems related any of these fields with complete easiness, it makes me feel that she is very confident of herself in whatever she does. While I also know another teacher who has specialized in biology and has confined herself to the world of biology alone. I completely agreethat it defintely is a difficult task studying a specific subject alone and specializing in it, however the advantages my friend's mother has over her is obviously more in number.
Receiving a broad knowledge on a variety of topics does not mean specializing in it on studying for it. It can also be achieved by mere reading.This is one reason why we are adviced to read newspapers. It helps us keep ourselves up dated with the incidents happening around us in this world. Reading books or magazines or any piece of article for that matter doea not go vain.
Schools and colleges also include a variety of subjects for the students in their academic programs in order to make them self confident and train them to face the hardships and obstacles they will come across in their future life.
I stongly feel that having a broader knowledge of many academic subjects is definitely more advantageous than the specializing in only one subject. It makes a person strong and helps him live in this challenging world with full confidence.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods and services, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them seem far more appealing than they actually are. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to purchase. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They often highlight only the most positive aspects of a product, while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For example, a commercial for a new weight loss supplement might showcase individuals achieving dramatic results in a short period, but fail to mention the potential side effects or the need for a healthy lifestyle alongside the supplement. This selective presentation creates a distorted image of the product, leading consumers to believe it is more effective than it truly is. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely heavily on emotional appeals and persuasive language to evoke positive feelings and associations with the product. They may use catchy jingles, celebrity endorsements, or heartwarming stories to create a sense of desirability and urgency. This emotional manipulation can cloud consumers' judgment and make them more susceptible to purchasing products that may not meet their actual needs.

"Life is worth to live. Young people live it more lively and older people live it in a more plain way within their physical limits, but they woud have lived it lively when they were young.

	I agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more as compared to older people. Young people are more energetic and more ambitious in their youth. They have the desire to bring sky down. Young people have the quality of persistence that is to keep trying to achieve their goal. This ability of theirs helps them to enjoy life and face all the hardships whatever comes on their way. For eg.: Youths always try new methods of entertainment which is full of dangers and risks. Like Bungee Jump, car race etc. Young people are always open to new ideas and they have the desire to explore the world. They implement new thoughts in teir way of living and enjoy life to the full.

	At the same time old people are not able to enjoy more in life. They spend most of the time in the memories of what they did in their young age. They are even not physically fit to do all the activities which a youth can do. In the old age the ability of persistence reduces. Old people dont have the desire to compete with the world to get the best. They always remain happy in what they have and in the way how they live. They are never open to new modern ideas and are not able to enjoy life as compared to youths.

	Finally i would like to say that, i am not against the old people. These are the people when young developed new ideas which the youg generation of this age is following and enjoying.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products and services. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them appear far superior to their actual capabilities. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to purchase. 

One compelling example of this exaggeration is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing in beauty advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve flawless skin, perfect proportions, and unrealistic features. This manipulation creates an unattainable standard of beauty, leading consumers to feel inadequate and more likely to purchase products that promise to achieve this idealized look. Similarly, food advertisements often employ techniques like close-up shots and vibrant colors to make dishes appear more appetizing than they truly are. The reality is that the food we see in these ads is often styled and manipulated to enhance its visual appeal, leading to disappointment when the actual product fails to live up to the unrealistic expectations. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals to sway consumers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, advertisers attempt to associate these positive emotions with their products. This tactic can be particularly effective in targeting vulnerable demographics, such as children or the elderly, who may be more susceptible to emotional manipulation. For instance, toy commercials often feature children laughing and playing with the advertised toys, creating a sense of joy and desirability that may not be reflected in the actual experience of playing with the toy. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately depict product features, the majority tend to exaggerate their qualities to entice consumers. The use of airbrushing, unrealistic portrayals, and emotional appeals all contribute to this tendency. By understanding the manipulative nature of advertising, consumers can become more discerning and avoid falling prey to unrealistic expectations.",
"Some people say that in their opinion it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. I mainly disagree to that opinion.
As a child and during the time of education at school to gain a broad knowledge is important. That is because for the life after school a child must find out in what it is interested. This is on the one hand important for the choice of profession and on the other for its own developmet. But later it is as well as important to specialize in a specific subject, because specific knowledge is very worthy. So for example a company is willing to pay a lot of money for employees who have specialized in a subject where only less people are specialized in. That is because their knowledge is rare.
Another point is that today the sum of academic knowledge is so big, that it is impossible for one person to specialize in every subject. But everzbody feels much better and is much prouder of himself, if he is specialised in a specific subject, than if he knows a bit of everything.
Third people are more interested in some things than in others. And if somebody is interested in something he will be able to learn more and faster than if he is not. According to that it is more efficient to specialize than to do not.
Last, based on the second point, there could no more scientific research been carried out if everybody would try to specialize on everything, because everybody would die before he would get to the point where he could start research.
So basically you must disagree with that statement.",
"Enjoyment is the basic ingredient of Life. Enjoyment basically needs time, mood and the passion for it. Enjoyment should not be trapped within the boundaries of age. An old person can also enjoy just like a young person does and sometime can do even more than youngsters so, I do not agree with the statement. 

Older people have more time to enjoy the life peacefully and comfortablly. Most of them are retired and are over with their responsibilities. They can always utilize this time in doing the thing they like and enjoy most. Fo instance i have a friend whose grand parent remain free all the time and mostly  they stay out of the house. They have joined so many clubs and societies. They visit some new tourist place every year for the sake of outing. They are living life much better than there son who is always busy with the loads of work. 

Old person does not have any responsibility on him so by that he can always enjoy his work, his trips better, regardless of what is happening back at home. They can concentrate only on present without thinking about risks of future because of the major responsibilities like kids , business has been covered or being tranfered to the kids. 

The enjoyment does not always means  freaking out with the friends, dancing, clubing etc. Every person has its own way to enjoy the life.Some person do not do any evident thing but still they enjoy their life For example my aunty enjoys sitting home, listening and reading mythological topics. She enjoys viewing her grand childrens activities a lot and these kind of things can only be tasted at the older age.

On the contrary older people are mostly the victims of some major health problems. They fail to enjoy the time because of their disabilities. They are not aware of the modern ways to enjoy and hence limit themselves to the  limited sphere of influence. They also have limited amount of money to finance their trips  mandatory for the enjoyment.

Finally i would epitomize it by saying that enjoyment does not sees the age, it just goes after your passion for it. However old you may be, however scarce you can be , you can always learn the ways to enjoy your life according to the circumstances",
"Generally speaking, advertisements make products attractive and desirable.
	Let me start from scratch, what is the point of an advertisement? It is of course to make sell. And why would someone buy an object if it seems useless and uneffective? As a result, advertisment naturally tries to make a product look interesting.
	It is true that consequently, advertisements sometimes make a product seem much better than it really is. Sometimes advertisements lie. Yet it is not necessarily in its own interest to lie to consumers since they are not so stupid, and once a consumer finds out that he had been betrayed, he will not buy the product of the advertisement anymore. It might get even worst : the betrayed consumer may not buy any other products of this company. That is why, advertisements must  be careful about what they are claiming, and they ought to win the consumer's trust by simply telling him what the true advantages of such or such product are.
	Yet, it is also true that advertisements tends to emphasize the pros of an object and to hide its disadvantages. This is  the implicit rule of business. Unfortunatly, in occidental societies this rule is a general  principle.  One cannot avoid it. So one must not be gullible. For these reasons, I am not shocked by advertisements even if they are false. One must simply be careful and read magazines about products that he wants to acquire.
	Besides, I believe that advertisement is a everyday enjoyment. It is part of our lifes, and i do think that they are some advertisements that are very well done and that are very enjoyable, even if they lie a little. I prefer an intersesting but lying commercial than a realistic boring one. Anywaym the main goal of advertisements is to ;ake a product known right? And what is ;ore striking that a beautiful advertisement?",
"The question faces an actual problem in the modern societies: the role of the young people in building the future society, through helping their communities - by means of a social, cultural and political help - and the capability of such young people to build themselves as individuals and part of the society they live in.
In order to explain my point of view I need of course to not take into account those societies in which young people grow in war zones and are not able - because they probably never got any chance - to really know a peaceful existence.
Said that, and in particular now talking about the society where I live, I agree with the statement expressed in the question. A lot of surveys, published in the most popular newspapers, show that young individuals just take care of their personal growth without considering how much they are touched by what happens around them. These surveys also demostrate how much young men and women are not aware of the improvements they could afford if they were able to really put themselves in an effective relation with their communities.
As to the reasons that can get young people to have such behaviour, I guess the most important is the will of personal success related to a deep indifference.  As a concept, indifference takes people - young or not - to not care the world's changing and in continous evolution.  Trying to find out the roots of this feature would seem to be a task, or a hard challenge as well, of the modern sociological sciences.  Than, in my opinion, the willing of personal success is the reason that explains such non-accuracy.  Young people fully involved in studies, careers, will of easily earn money, seem to forget the place they come from.",
"We live in a society that depends on technology for everything, cars, motorcycles, airplains,TV's, DVD's, anything that we can imagine or think about needing its already there, so naturally we get bomberded by the media with a lot of products that are not useful,a and most of the time they dont even work! that's why I believe that advertisements make products seem better than they really are.

Now days we as a society have developed, a comsuming disease! everything new that comes up we need, but eventually after months of using the products we stop using them! so the rates star to come down! what is the first thing enterprises do? they tell lies! and we have such a fragil mind that just because we saw that it works on TV, or hear it on the radio, we buy it again an ,again, an gain.

Another problem, will be that the media uses  artits in their advertisements to promote and to increase sales, this usally causes a person to buy a product that is not healthy, that not only does not serves it's porpuses ,but in must cases can harm you! only because the girl holding the coke has a great body, does not mean your gonna get one if you drink one, or becauuse a a guy uses a certain type of lotion he is going to get all the females to go after him, or that if Brad Pitt drives an Audi, you have a chance to become a super star by buying one for yourself!

in conclusion, our community gets affected by the media, advertisments, magazines and all sorts of things telling us what to do or what not to do, what to wear or what not wear, so we end up  buying things that we dont need or want, products that are not effective or usefull , OR WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL, just because we are led to believe by advertisements that , that's in fact what we need, just by making products seem better that they really are!",
"Most advertiments that companies made for themselves look really good and perfect conducts for every consumers. However, consumers have experienced that conducts, they always made bad compliments about their conducts that they had already used because of too much expectations about conducts. However, I agree the reason that why most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are to consumers. There are two reasons. 
 The first reason of most advertisements emphasize much better than they really are is appealing to consumers. If companies want to appeal to their consumers, they have to make a kind of 'fantasy' to them about their products. If they don't do that and they say about  the truth, that couldn't appeal their consumers' market at all. In addition, if consumers heard just truth, they would think about their product as just normal other things. Then, it can be same things like other products. There are no differences. Therefore, for using some fantasy about their products, it would be a good way to appeal their consumers and markets. 
 The second reason of most advertisements look better than they really are is about their goal. Naturally the most important thing in each companies is about their goal that sell their products as much as possible. When the companies make some advertisements, they have to think a new and creative way to sell. On advertisements, most companies have to show only good side about their products to consumers. Therefore, consumers might think that companies make fun of their consumer. However, that is not true. 
 In conclusion, it is the only way to appeal and sell their products to consumers for showing much better things than they are. When consumers are seeing some commercials and they think "" Wow, that is going to be really useful! I want to have it!"". I think that the conduct  is ready to be sold. That commercial is really good. The last my thinking about commercial is that commercial is made for 'cheating' to consumers.",
"Yes, i agree that young people enjoy more than older people. Young age means the teenage where most of the people spoil their life rather moulding it into a good future. They study till the secondary school but as soon as they enter into their college life they enjoy rather concentrate on their studies. He is not aware of the future experiences and problems he would face.
                           Young people enjoy in their teenage keeping studies aside. Most of the people in their young age are not aware of the future. They just waste time in enjoying and partying. so that they cannot became a successful person in these society. He cannot reach his goal. Every person has their on goal but we have to fulfill. By enjoying we waste half of our life and suffer half of the life. Their is no use of recognition after the teenage is passed.
                                They think that they have grown up and can handle their decisions on their own. they think that they know what is right and what is wrong. They go on for parties without the permission of parents and return late nights. They smoke, they drink and commits lots of mistakes. They break the parents reputations. But the same person when he comes to old age he shall think of the past what he have done. He stops all the enjoyments and concentrate on the works and settlement. He thinks as a mature person.
                             Young people are not matured and cannot take decisions on their own. They live in a world of fantasy, passionate and fashionable. He wanders on the streets and creates havoc to the public. Most of the young people who thinks in a better way get settles in life but those are still on roads. so everything is in our hands, we should have to change our life according to ur wish.",
"I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more  than older people do. 

The term ""enjoying life"" can be viewed at from many different angles and each individual will have an own way to explain this phrase. But taking into account all possible aspects I can think of right now, the above mentioned statement seems agreeable to me. 

Compared to the past, the youth in our society today has the freedom to achieve almost everything - from enjoying a financially secured family background and a prestigious education in school to all personal favourites, such as sports, socializing with others, and the arts. 

Young people are energetic and can do whatever physical challenge there is to meet. They can travel the world during their studies, they can choose from a variety of plans for their career, and are most of the times preferably hired by employees compared to the elderly.

But most of all, they enjoy a wide-spread portfolio pf personal enjoyment. In a society focused mainly on the younger citizens, the ways to enjoy yourself seem unlimited: dance clubs, bars, sport clubs, travel agencies, internet chat rooms and platforms all offer their services to their young customers. If you are young, you are in! All doors seem opened. 

Older people often feel excluded from such activities due to bad health, lack of energy or acceptance by the young. They often fail to catch up with the fast and immensly important development in the telecommunication sector and do not find many possibilities to share time with others. 

An example for this striking difference between the desired young people and the rejected older ones can be found at any time of the day in an ordinary chat room. The chat users tend to ask for the age and the sex of the one they are corresponding with. Not seldomly they close the chat window when the answer is ""28""! 

Of course, there are quite a few offers for older people, too. But I witness a development in our society that mainly  the young people are enjoying themselves. Maybe the older should get more motivation to learn new skills in order to enjoy their lives. But maybe the young should accept and respect the fact that one day they too will be old. If our society achieves THAT, then ALL will enjoy their lives more.",
"The topic discuss about the less time that the young people have to halping their communities.
I think that the young people have a lot of time for helping their communities but they don`t want help it.
For example, I go to help a lot of young students to study and to learnt every weeks.
I study at the university and play guitar in a rock band but I have more time to helping my communities.
The young people nowadays think only about  to theirself.
In my opinion, we need to educated all people to give their time to their communities but this way is not simple because today all people think that is better stay at thieir home to play a playstation than help who have a problem.
On the other hand, Life is more difficult and quikly than 100 years ago and  the young people don`t go to the community because they go in the city to study and when they return at home they are more tired.
In addittion the country don`t have a good place for education and for meet other people.
In conclusion, I think that the government need to gives places and he need to does an activity in the schooltime for increase in the young people the want to helping the other people with their ability and possibility.",
"The world of advertising is a dazzling spectacle, filled with promises of happiness, success, and fulfillment, all tied to the purchase of a particular product. While some advertisements accurately portray the benefits of a product, I strongly agree that most tend to exaggerate, making products seem far better than they truly are. This exaggeration is achieved through a variety of techniques, often employing emotional appeals and carefully crafted imagery. 

One of the most common tactics is the use of emotional appeals. Advertisements often depict idealized scenarios, featuring happy families, successful individuals, and glamorous lifestyles. These images evoke feelings of desire and aspiration in the viewer, subtly associating those feelings with the product being advertised. For example, a commercial for a particular brand of coffee might show a group of friends laughing and enjoying themselves over a cup of coffee, implying that purchasing this brand will lead to a more fulfilling social life. However, the reality is that the coffee itself is unlikely to be the sole factor in achieving such a lifestyle. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on carefully crafted imagery and selective information to create a false impression. A beauty product might be advertised using a model with flawless skin, but the advertisement might fail to mention the extensive use of makeup and Photoshop in creating the image. Similarly, a car commercial might showcase the vehicle's sleek design and impressive performance on a winding mountain road, but it might not mention the vehicle's poor fuel efficiency or high maintenance costs. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can provide valuable information about products, it is important to be aware of their inherent tendency to exaggerate. By recognizing the techniques used to create a false impression, consumers can make more informed decisions about their purchases and avoid falling prey to the allure of products that may not live up to their advertised promises.",

"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local clean-up drives to advocating for environmental sustainability, young people are taking the lead in addressing pressing issues. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, showcases their commitment to creating positive change. These young activists dedicate significant time and effort to raising awareness and pushing for policy changes, demonstrating a deep concern for their communities and the future.
Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time and skills to support various organizations. From tutoring underprivileged children to assisting at local shelters, they contribute to improving the lives of others. The prevalence of volunteer programs in schools and universities encourages young people to develop a sense of empathy and responsibility towards their communities. These experiences foster a sense of belonging and empower them to become active citizens.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From leading social movements to volunteering their time, young people are actively engaged in making a difference. Their dedication and commitment to creating a better world should be acknowledged and celebrated.",
"The statement at hand expresses a strongly generalized opinion on a nowadays very fervent issue. It states that young people are disinclined to get involved in their communities. One must pay special attention to the fact that the statement only concerns a particular group in society, which is defined by age, and disregards any other group.

At first, I want to point out my personal opinion: I do completely agree with the statement at hand. But for generalization reasons, one must explain why young people behave the way they do.

To utterly comprehend the everyday life of young people and the prodigious amount of stress and challenges a young person faces today, one must view the world through the eyes of a young person:
One might assume that academic achievement and the fulfillment of the need for social interaction are the only two major challenges youth is facing nowadays. This is, however, slightly superficial. 

The competition in times of economic hardship and rising unemployment is tough. In order to maintain the hope of being able to compete against lots of applicants for all sorts of institutions, one must maintain excellent grades. This is putting the current generation under severe pressure. 

Moreover, there is a growing gap between the individual and his/her parents. The relationship with one's family is increasingly troubled, which leads to a loss of love and personal support. Friends have to compensate for this.

The world of today is fast-moving and seldom is there a moment to settle down comfortably. Youth has to overcome obstacles which range from suffering support by one's family to drugs and loss of orientation. Youth faces much.

Consequently, helping one's community is not a thing most young people pay particular attention to, because they are overly concerned with much more ""important"" issues.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to delve deeply into one specific subject or to explore a broad range of academic disciplines has been a topic of debate for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual flexibility, promotes interdisciplinary thinking, and equips individuals with a more comprehensive understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to approach problems from multiple perspectives. In a world characterized by complex challenges, a specialized perspective can often be limiting. For instance, a scientist with only a deep understanding of biology might struggle to address environmental issues that require knowledge of economics, policy, and social behavior. Conversely, someone with a broad knowledge base can draw upon diverse fields to develop innovative solutions. 

Secondly, a broad education encourages interdisciplinary thinking, which is crucial for tackling complex problems. The boundaries between academic disciplines are increasingly blurred, and many contemporary issues require insights from multiple fields. For example, understanding the impact of climate change necessitates knowledge of physics, biology, economics, and social sciences. A broad education fosters the ability to connect ideas across different disciplines, leading to more comprehensive and insightful solutions. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enhances one's ability to communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds. In today's interconnected world, individuals are increasingly interacting with people from different fields and cultures. A broad education equips individuals with the vocabulary and understanding necessary to engage in meaningful conversations and collaborate effectively across disciplines. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in the modern world. It fosters intellectual flexibility, promotes interdisciplinary thinking, and enhances communication skills. By embracing a diverse range of academic subjects, individuals can become more well-rounded, adaptable, and capable of navigating the complexities of the 21st century.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them seem much better than they truly are. This exaggeration is achieved through various techniques, such as selective presentation, emotional appeals, and misleading claims. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often focus on the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a new weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals achieving dramatic results, but fail to mention the possible side effects or the need for lifestyle changes. This selective presentation creates an unrealistic expectation that the product will deliver miraculous outcomes. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. They use catchy jingles, heartwarming stories, or images of attractive people to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. These emotional appeals can cloud consumers' judgment and make them more susceptible to purchasing products that may not actually meet their needs. 

In addition to selective presentation and emotional appeals, advertisers often make misleading claims about their products. They may use vague language, such as “clinically proven” or “scientifically tested,” without providing any concrete evidence to support their assertions. Such claims can be deceptive and lead consumers to believe that a product is more effective or reliable than it actually is. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may present products truthfully, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits and qualities. Through selective presentation, emotional appeals, and misleading claims, advertisers create an idealized image of products that often fails to reflect reality. Consumers must be aware of these tactics and exercise critical thinking when evaluating advertisements to make informed purchasing decisions.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young individuals contribute to their communities. While it's true that some young people might prioritize personal pursuits over community involvement, countless others actively engage in various forms of service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.


One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local food drives and environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice causes, young people are using their energy and creativity to address pressing issues within their communities. These initiatives often involve collaboration with peers, fostering a sense of collective action and empowerment. Moreover, many young people dedicate their time to volunteering at local organizations, such as hospitals, libraries, and animal shelters, providing invaluable support to those in need.


Furthermore, the digital age has opened up new avenues for community engagement. Young people are leveraging social media platforms to raise awareness about important issues, mobilize support for charitable causes, and connect with like-minded individuals. This online activism allows them to reach a wider audience and contribute to positive change on a larger scale.


In conclusion, while it's important to acknowledge that not all young people actively engage in community service, it's equally important to recognize the numerous ways in which they contribute to their communities. From traditional volunteering to innovative online activism, young people are demonstrating a commitment to making a difference, challenging the notion that they are apathetic towards their surroundings.",
"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The main reason of making products seem much better than they really are is achieving maximum profit out of selling the biggest amount possible through putting an over rated image of your product in your consumers' mind.

	Companies make their products seem much better than they really are to an extent that they create an illusion in the consumer's mind by playing on his emotions and feelings. They create an idea through the advertisement into the consumer's mind that their product is the answer for his problems.  
	
	Excessive competetive advertisements makes a lot of distraction in consumers' minds which obliges companies to make their product seem much better than they really are and to an extent of making their product better than all of the other competetive products; in other words to make their product ""The Unique Product"".

	Many advertisements give their products an over rated image which obliges other companies to give their product an over rated image or else their product will be considered weak among the other over rated products.

	Although some advertisements do not make their products seem much better than they really are but most of the advertisement do.",
"First of all, having broad knowledge in many academic subjects is necessary to be able to understand the world we live in, particularly the economic, political and social issues. Indeed, broad knowledge of many academic subjects, which are espacially tought at school and at the university, allows you to get a general and personal culture of almost every subject, like History, Geography or Literrature. Of course, in that way you can not be a specialist of all those subjects, but at least you can discuss with people and have your own opinion about things. On top of that, broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes you more mature and confident to start learning additionnal specific subjects. It is, then, necesary to have this general knowledge to be able to go on.

	However, specializing in on specific subject makes you more performant on a specific topic you are interested in,  and allows you to enhance your own skills by making research or reading magazine about it. Thus, you become a specialist of the subject and may be the best in that subject. Besides, when you are specialized and maybe passionnate about something, you can try to find a job related to your specialization and be good at it. 

	As for me, the both statements expressed in that sentence are both correct and necessary. Indeed, as we won't never be aware of all the subjects, it is the best to have broad knowledge about the most possible things, to be able to understand the issues, the problems and more generally the world. But then, we should specialize in a subject we really like, in order to concentrate on a personnal interest and to improve our knowledge about a specific topic. That is why, the best for me would be to combine both of those aspects that is to say first learn the most academic subjects we can to be able, then, to specialize and be good in a specific subject.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they experience more joy is a simplistic generalization. Both age groups have unique advantages and challenges that shape their perspectives on life. 

Firstly, young people often have fewer responsibilities and commitments. They are free to explore their passions, travel, and experiment with different experiences. This freedom can undoubtedly lead to a sense of excitement and adventure. However, this lack of responsibility can also be a double-edged sword. The pressure to succeed, find their place in the world, and navigate the complexities of adulthood can create significant stress and anxiety. 

On the other hand, older people have accumulated wisdom and experience. They have weathered life's storms and learned valuable lessons. This perspective allows them to appreciate the simple things in life and find contentment in their relationships and achievements. While they may not have the same physical energy as younger individuals, they often possess a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is subjective and depends on individual circumstances and perspectives. While young people may experience a certain thrill from novelty and exploration, older people can find fulfillment in the richness of their experiences and the wisdom they have gained. It is not a matter of one age group enjoying life more than the other, but rather a matter of different stages of life offering unique opportunities for joy and fulfillment.",
"Nowadays we can find lots of products in the market. In order to sell these products, there are also many advertisements.  I do agree this this statement which says that most of advertisements make products seem much beter than they really are.


First,  for example when you see in television some products, it attracts you. Then when you go shopping and you bring this product at home. But, when you taste it you are very disapointed because you do not feel like the person on the advertisment . You feel unhappy. It is true that sometimes I buy products that I have seen in advertisement. For example, last time I bought some yoghurts I saw in advertisement, and it was said that it is not too sweet. I do not tell you my dissatisfaction when I put one spoon fo this in my mouth. But It was too sweet! Thus, the advertisment lies.

Secondly, some advertisements draw you attention because the picture you see is very pretty and attractive. So you decide to find this good you see and o the market where you can bring it. Sometimes what you see do not correspond to what you have seen in the advertisement. I would like to state you one of my experience. I am not one of those who like to watch television but when I put it on and decide to see some program I look even advertisement. Anyway, I saw a vaccum in advertisement and decided to go and see it. Of course I intended to buy it. But I do not because it does not look like what I saw, however it was exactly the same product.

To conclude, I would just want to you aware of the fact that often advertisements are not true. Their aim is to make you buy thier products and to show attractive things. Consequently, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.",
"In my openion young people enjoy life more than older people do for several reasons. I do agree with the statment because I have experienced life and I have seen it.

First, young people, children and kids don't have any wories about any thing. They don't think of bills to pay or rents or what to eat or drink. Their minds are full of imaginations for their little world. For example, they have wild way of dressing up, like a prinsess or a solder. They have a wild way of drawing, they draw their family not the best way or in a professinal way but in a way that make them feel happy and satisfied.

Another reason is,they like to have fun and be happy in all situations. all they think of play, play play. They can all day long if you leave them with toys and friends. When they fight they don't talk to each other for a minute or tow but after that they plat together like nothing happened. Adultes however, don't talk to the person that they are mad at for days, monther, and even years. For example, my sister got into a fight with her best friend and did not speak to her friend for a very log time. This caused their relationship to be broken untile this very day.

Finally, young people have young minds that are open to new thing and new ideas and learning. Kids learn faster than an audalts can. This show how they enjoy life and use it to make them happy almos in every situation of their lives.

In conclution, I believe that young people can and are enjoyiny life more than older people can. You can see that through the exampels that I have described in this essay and also through experience of life. I did not live my childhood life bacuse of many reasons that I will not discuss but I have learned to enjoy my life because I live it like a kid.",
"In today's consumerist society, advertising plays a crucial role in shaping our perceptions of products and services. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many others employ persuasive techniques to make products seem far more appealing than they truly are. I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, creating an unrealistic expectation that often leads to disappointment.


One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is the use of carefully selected imagery and language. For instance, a commercial for a new shampoo might feature a model with flowing, lustrous hair, implying that using the product will transform anyone's hair into a similar state. However, the reality is that the model's hair is likely enhanced with professional styling and lighting, and the shampoo itself may not be as effective as the advertisement suggests.


Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers. They might showcase heartwarming scenes of families enjoying a particular brand of food or depict individuals achieving success after using a specific product. These emotional appeals can create a strong desire for the product, even if it is not truly necessary or beneficial.


In conclusion, while some advertisements may be informative and truthful, the majority employ deceptive tactics to make products seem more desirable than they actually are. The use of carefully crafted imagery, emotional appeals, and exaggerated claims can create unrealistic expectations and lead to consumer dissatisfaction. It is essential for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",

1) As am a young boy  ,  i myself formed a group in my street , and we held elections , i was selected as the head of the youth.my duty is to look   about the welfare of the society , so what i did is ,i started collected money every week from the individuals , and i started helping the communities,
2) we should agree te statement that youth are participating in the community development ,  because as we have  many players who represent their own country ,say for example great crickter  master blastyer sachin tendulkar he has satarted a community  in india , from which he can help nearly 10 thousand people to survive their lifes ,
3)maria sharapoa, aNdrew raddick , sanis mirza who are the famous tennis players the hepl the community by giving up their renumarations which they receive from the different corporate companies.
4)every country  has got their own respect to their cedit, development in the community depends on the developmnt of the country,so individual government has taking its own individual rules regulations.
5) youth  has always get associated with the communities
we have different kinds of communities , say islam community, christian comunity , inindia we have hindu commmunity,  so every religion must look upon their own community development systems/.
6) even in christianity we d have many kinds of communities.They say catholics, protestents , and they have different kind things they have.
 If youth donot find time in helping communities then how these many communities are there ,  
Every community has its own passion , they have different cultures , they have many aims to their credit people often  participatein community meetings.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly using their technological skills to address social issues. From creating online platforms to raise awareness about environmental concerns to organizing virtual fundraisers for disaster relief, they leverage technology to mobilize resources and amplify their impact. For example, the recent surge in online activism, particularly among young people, has brought attention to issues like climate change and racial injustice, leading to real-world policy changes. 

Secondly, young people are actively involved in traditional forms of community service. Volunteering at local soup kitchens, mentoring underprivileged children, and participating in neighborhood clean-up drives are just a few examples of their dedication. Many schools and universities also encourage community engagement through service-learning programs, where students gain valuable experience while contributing to their communities. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that young people's contributions to their communities extend beyond formal volunteering. They often engage in informal acts of kindness, such as helping elderly neighbors with errands, organizing neighborhood events, or simply being supportive friends and family members. These seemingly small acts have a profound impact on the well-being of their communities. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From leveraging technology to engaging in traditional forms of service, young people are actively working to make a positive difference in the world. Their dedication and innovation should be celebrated and encouraged, rather than dismissed with sweeping judgments.",
"We are living where has the plenty of advertisement. We see any kind of ads everyday, even if we wouldn't want to. And most of them make themselves look better. It heppens all the time. I sometimes believed the advertisements and I bought several Items. Whenever I trusted them, they brought me down.

 I saw advertising heater which was advertising on TV. I thought that looked so good. and I bought it. but that was not my expection. that was not smae color. Turely, the shape was not same at all. The advertisement  told me that was not breaking at all but I used third time it was borken. I was really angry at that time. Other product wre mostly alike.

After that I saw an ad of  hair dryer. The ads, it made my hair be like to silk and was not hurt my hair at all. But that didn't make a sence. How did the hair dryer make your hair be silk? I couldn't believe the ads at all. I thought that people who made the ads didn't have any conscious. 

When I went shopping, I showed a sign on the window. It said the sale 'buy one get one free for all items.' And I chosed two of hand rotions. When I tried to check out, the saler said. The products I chosed didn't include the slaes product. I was 
 
Bunch of advertisements attract people to buy them. But most of them that is not a true. So, people should check between ads and real product and make sure it is ok. And we must not buy a product which has a difference between ads and products.",
"In my limited experience, it is quite true that more and more youngsers neglect their own communities and pay scarce time and attention on hepling their communities. Personal speaking, I  think that there are three possible causes of this results. First, more youngsters are taught to study harder and focus on their schoolwork, and this may make them more self-centered because teachers and even their parents require them to pursue their own accomplishment or higher grades in every contests. Thus the younsters surrouded only by this information gradually accept this thought and are less willing to attend the publich issues, like helping their communities. Second, it might be possible that the youngsters spend their time with their own friends playing the basketball or baseball, studying and preparing for the exams, or something eles. Whateve they do, they always take activities together, and stay in their own groups; therefore, if the original goal of their groups is not to help their communities, they will never touch such issues. We all know the power of the group to constrain the members to obey and do those things recognized by other members, so this would be one of the reasons that cause them unwilling to help their communities. Last but not the least, such events may be caused by the lack of their passion to help others. Our education system always uses the acheivement in the school performance or the grades in the exams to assess the potential of the students as a reference of selection in university entrance exam, and therefore both the students and their parents place this event a top priority, so no wonder there are less and less youngsters who devote themselves to the public issues and are happy to help others, including their communities. In summary, I think it is the ignorance of public issues that causes them pay much attention on helping their communities.",
"People who have broad knowledge of many academic subject provide only little contribute to the world's future compare to poeple whose specialized in on of their specific subjuct.

People who have braod knowledge on many subject seems have very strong commenscence of living becasue they know every from huge amount of study areas done in their school life. But is someone ask them something that's relate to one subject in very detail. Then, these people would not be able to answer the question. In the other hand,  if some one's good at specific area. then the question would be answered easily  with deatils and many facts. 

Broad knowledge is more likely to be people studying in the high school. They are forecd to take every subjects in order to finsih the high school and going to the college, where people learn the specific area of knowledge of what they are really interested in and willing to do things as job relate to it in the future.  The college offers great education because the task of the student is so hard and is similar to what the world is going on. But the high school only provide the basic knowledge of the subjects. 

if the broad knowlede couldn't answer the hard question, that means that they have very minimal pocibility to contribute the world or even contribut to their own life. for example, there are two people wanted to draw and greatest art in this world, one of them are only have high school  eduction level, and other one has finshed the art college and actually drawing as his job. it is definitely that people would think the one who's mastered on drawing have the bigger chance to make the world's greatest art piece. And ignored the person who only can draw stick man with round head for sure.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that overlooks the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, a significant number actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work. Organizations like Habitat for Humanity and local soup kitchens rely heavily on the energy and enthusiasm of young volunteers. These individuals dedicate their time to building homes, serving meals, and supporting those in need, showcasing their commitment to making a difference. For instance, the recent surge in youth participation in environmental activism, with groups like Fridays for Future mobilizing young people to fight climate change, demonstrates their dedication to addressing pressing societal issues. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and resources to create positive change. Through social media platforms, they raise awareness about important causes, organize online campaigns, and mobilize their peers to take action. The rise of online crowdfunding platforms allows young people to directly support community initiatives and charities, demonstrating their financial contributions to social good. 

In conclusion, while some young people may not actively engage in traditional forms of community service, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. From volunteering their time to utilizing technology for social change, young people are actively shaping their communities and demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. It's important to recognize and celebrate these efforts rather than perpetuate the misconception that they are apathetic towards their communities.",
"I do not agree that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. Altough young people are physically more active and healthier then the older, thus, may have more energy to engage in enjoyable activities, older people have also some advantges of the old ages provide them.

Young poeple are energetic and active, hence,  often dominate most of the daily life activities we see around. However, when compared to older people, younger ones have more responsibilty, which hinders their opportunity to enjoy life. For example, I and my sister are working in full time jobs,  which make us to spend all day in work. Besides that, we are studying for graduate degrees and this takes most of our free time. However, my granparents who are now enjoying their retirement years, spend their days with shopping, wandering around, travelling and hosting family members in the weekends. 

Another advantage older people have is that they have been cared by other family members more than the younger ones have been. In my culture, senior people are highly respected. They have been consulted for experiences they have and for the knowledge they acquired throughout their life span. That is, they are often visited by familty members, by relatives,which is giving them opportunity to interact socially even sometimes more then young people do. 

One other point is that having developed a mature taste of preferences, older poeple do not spend time trying new things spend their times in a more quality way. Yet, young people generally like trying new things as if they have not developed  permanent life preferences. In other words, young people can be thought as they are still in their life cycle, which can be characterized by flcutuations in tastes and preferences.

 Therefore, I cannot agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Both age groups have their own advantages and disadvantages. While young people may be healthier and more active than old people, older people can enjoy many different aspects of life. The more important thing is that regardless of the age you are in, one should know how to enjoy life.",
"One need to spend at least few hours to help their communities, which ultimately helps in increasing the living standards. I agree with the statment that young people are not spending enough time to help their communities.

Why I am holding that opinion is because of these reasons. First younger people are now more concentrating on their studies, which is mandatory in the modern life. Because of the cut throat competition in the modern world, they need to be good in their courses, obviously it means that they have to spend more time on their course. So they have less chances of concentrating on the communities welfare.

Second younger generation people are more attracted towards fashion, which is ruling the campuses now a days. For that they are spending a lot of time on clothes and jewellery. It one of the reason why they are not involving in the community work.

Third  younger people are more interested in video games and other common sports. Because sports gives more fun, which might be one of the reason. Why this phenomena is happening because they are not feeling responsible for the communities welfare.

It happened in my case when I was studying I am not at all intersted in community work, all the time I spent on my university work and sports. That time I am not aware of the community benefits. Slowly I realised the benefits of the community work in improving the living standards.

In short, younger people are not spending time on community welfare, but by the guidance they will know the importance.",
"A broad knowledge of many different subjects give you the ability to face much more situations, understand them and how they inceract, makes you more flexible and gives you a more complete view of the world urrounding.
A specific knowledge allows you to interact in the best way possible with one subject, but your scope is limited to it.
Personally I prefer to have a broad knowledge, because the world isn't a serie of sealed rooms, so the ability to deal with more than one situation is vital. A too specialized competence laks in the whole-view, fourthermore it holds you in only one context.",
"In the realm of education, a perennial debate rages on: is it more advantageous to possess a broad knowledge base across various academic subjects or to delve deeply into a single specialization? While specialization undoubtedly offers profound expertise, I firmly believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial, fostering intellectual versatility, adaptability, and a holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to connect ideas and concepts from different disciplines. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics can better analyze the social and economic factors that shaped historical events. Similarly, a scientist with a background in philosophy can critically evaluate the ethical implications of scientific advancements.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's dynamic job market, individuals are increasingly required to navigate diverse fields and adapt to new challenges. A broad knowledge base provides the foundation for acquiring new skills and knowledge quickly, making individuals more employable and adaptable to evolving demands.
Finally, a broad education cultivates intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. By exploring various subjects, individuals develop a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge and the beauty of human intellectual endeavors. This passion for learning fuels personal growth and enriches one's life beyond the confines of a specific profession.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more enriching and rewarding educational experience. It fosters intellectual versatility, adaptability, and a lifelong love of learning, equipping individuals with the skills and perspectives necessary to thrive in a complex and ever-changing world.",
"Young people will take the control of our country. They are our's future. we educate them. However , nobody think the future and young people aren't important for them. if younp people give enough time to helping their communities , everybody understand them.

"Have you ever been mislead by a TV or a  web page advertisement, and bought something  you were not completley statisfied ? I have, that is why I belive that  advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, I think this occurs for simple reasons:  people want to sell, and internet and TV makes it easy. 

Selling more means winning more money. Acutally, the purpose of advertising is to sell more, they do this by making the pruduct  attractive. The thing is that there is a diference between advertising the product and tricking people into buying something that is not true. The sad part is that there is lot of people that are willing to risk their reputation in order to win more money.

Latley, buying through internet has become more and more popular. It is cheaper, easy ,and you can do it right at home. The problem with on-line and TV purchases is that you are unable to see the object that you want to buy fisically. There are many well known web-pages in which you know you will have no problems. For example, I bought  the Toefl test online, and recive exactly what I bought. The problem comes when you are dealing something less formal. For example, if you are planning a vacation and are planning to stay in a home and breakfast, you must check twice the place. The owners always take the best pictures of their houses and even use photoshop. Some times when the change is so drastic that you feel that it is not the place you saw on your computer screen, so you feel decive.

All in all, I belive that most advertisments do make products seem better than they really are. I belive it is in their nature, since its purpose it to sell more.. I do not belive that most advertisments want to decive people, but I strongly recommend not to buy online unless it is a recognized webpage.",
"Nowadays, as we all noticed, advertisements have been becoming more and more atractive .
   As far as i am concerned, i totally agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
    Indeed, first of all because i believe that it is a kind of marketing just to make people choosing one specific brand and not an other one. For instance,  you can quickly think that you want to buy something that you had see on T.V. whereas, if you did not have see it you even may not know that the product exist before.
     Moreover, secondly i am convinced that advertisements are liable to lie about the quality but also about the apparence of the products. Infact, most of the time, a product can seem the best of the world on the picture and when you go to buy it, you are generaly disapointed.
      Finally, even if, sometimes, the product conrespond exactly to what the advertisement show , that case remain very seldom today.
     Furthermore, because of the progress of new technology , you can now modify pictures even on television in order to turn them more atractive and interesting for people.
  As a conclusion i would say that we do not have to trust in apparences but better in our own opinion of the product just to avoid falling in the new consomation society. That is the only way to be less disapointed byt",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts across different disciplines. For example, a historian with an understanding of economics can better analyze the impact of trade on historical events. Similarly, a scientist with a background in philosophy can critically evaluate the ethical implications of their research. This interdisciplinary approach leads to more nuanced and insightful perspectives. 

Secondly, a broad education equips individuals with greater adaptability in a rapidly changing world. The job market is increasingly demanding individuals with diverse skills and the ability to learn new things quickly. A person with a broad knowledge base is more likely to thrive in such an environment, as they can readily apply their knowledge to new challenges and adapt to changing circumstances. 

Finally, a broad education fosters intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. By exploring different subjects, individuals develop a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge and the vastness of human understanding. This curiosity motivates them to continue learning throughout their lives, enriching their personal and professional journeys.

"Of course many people might think, that the youth has become more egoistic and at a certain point I agree with that. If you take a look on the big cities, you see everyone living on his own, maybe additionally caring about his parents and his girlfriend, but that is all. In my opinion this is just an brief impression. If you take a deeper look, you would find out, that there are still a lot of beneficial clubs, who do spend time helping the community even without being paid.
And that's why I think the situation has not changed in the recent years, there are just more youths living in the cities and the people tend to see only that ones, that do not care. Especially in smaller towns, there are a lot of young people, who want to help others for example in sport clubs or at church. I know a lot of people at my age, who are interested in these things. Concerning myself, I am member in the football club in my town, where I do the train for almost 20 kids together with a friend. Sometimes this is very hard and exhausting, but it is just such a fantastic feeling to do something for the kids. Especially because I know, how I appreciated the football train the time I was in their age.
Moreover I am also member of a youth group, that belongs to the church. With this group we often organize trips for younger members to the zoo or bike-tours. Once a year we have a one-week camp, sleeping in tents. This is really exciting, because instead of shopping or watching TV, we are singing or playing games in the nature, which is really something totally different from the dayly life. Sometimes we also organize something for the older people in our town, like drinking coffee or playing cards. In my opinion there is nothing better than a simple ""thank you"" or even just a smile on the face of a young boy or girl. So in addition, especially in smaller cities or towns there are still young people, who are encouraged in helping others.",
"Today for the succesfull of a product to make advertisements it is necessarily. Becouse a lot of products are same for caractheristics and price and will become the best that with the better advertisements. For this reason in a big company but even in a small company there is a group of people that they study the way to obtain the best advertisement. Some time there are even advertisements no true.  In particular on the tv there are a lot of advertisements to make products seem much better then thay really are. Using the tv it is more easy for a company to show a product very nice. For example if you put a car in an advertisement  with a nice girl, it is more easy that people want to buy the car. As far as i am concerned it is no correct to make products seem much better than they really are, but this is the law of the busuness.
In this way a company can have some advantages and some disadvantages.
With this kind of advertisement a factory can send more products, but after the first time the custumers understand that the quality of the product is not so nice and thay will not buy the product another time.
I think the best way it is to make a correct advertisement without to tell something no true. It is important compair ours product with the product of an other company and to tell becouse ours product it is better. For example Infostrada and other pnone company use this kind of advertisements and they have a lot of succesful.",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has become increasingly relevant. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial in the long run. This is because a well-rounded education fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of different disciplines. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems from multiple perspectives. By studying diverse subjects, students develop a comprehensive understanding of different methodologies, theories, and approaches. This allows them to analyze information more effectively, identify potential biases, and formulate well-informed conclusions. For instance, a student with knowledge in both history and economics can better understand the causes and consequences of historical events, considering both social and economic factors. 

Secondly, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a constantly changing world. As technology advances and industries evolve, individuals with specialized knowledge may find themselves limited in their career options. However, those with a broad base of knowledge can readily adapt to new challenges and opportunities. For example, a student with a background in literature, science, and technology can seamlessly transition between different fields, making them more employable in a diverse job market. 

Finally, a broad education cultivates a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of different disciplines. By studying subjects across various fields, students gain a holistic perspective on the world. They recognize how seemingly disparate areas of knowledge are intertwined, fostering a sense of interconnectedness and a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. For example, a student with knowledge in both biology and philosophy can better understand the ethical implications of scientific advancements, leading to more informed and responsible decision-making. 

In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial in the long run. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of different disciplines, preparing individuals for success in an ever-changing world.",
"I think it is true that the younger people enjoy more of their life than the older people do.  And I have three points to support with.  
	First, younger age is ""free"".  Except going to school and doing homeworks, young people have more time than the elders.  Considering ""adults"" spending time with anything regarding their jobs, such as meetings and getting ready for the presentations or even raising children, it is obvious that young people have more time than the older people do.  
	Second, young people have less to worry about.  New house, paying taxes, promotions, raising children.  These are none of the options that younger people would have in mind to consider.  The few things they might think of would be boy/girlfriends, schoolworks, college or getting jobs even.  Except few groups of peole who take them too seriously, those are not desperately important or I should say ""deep"" matters.  Comparing to those of adults, young people have less things to concern, which help them to enjoy their time even more.  
	Third, and for the last, young people is literally ""young"".  They have more chances to try out for many things.  For example, the adults usually don't get chances to try out for musical or sport team if their major or fields are different.  But in middle or high school, or even in college, young people get lots of chance to try a bit of everything, so to speak.  And I think the more you try, there's more possibilities that you'll like, and have a good time.  
	So for these three reasons, I think young people have more chances to, and do enjoy life more than older people do.",
"I didn't agree with the statement that ""It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject."" why means it was a known fact that ""Knowing every tthing about something is better than Knowing something about everything."" and also it causes poor knowledge in the fild an individual has to be choosen for sustainment. It will be clearly dicussed in the following lines.
              Firstly,What a person needs is that the term  ""Profficiency"". Because it would be the thing that the modern world needs.Every field needs the people to be profficient in that field and a little or no knowledge in other fields.Even the most famous scientists whose inventions may stick to thir feild. So every individual needs himself to be expertise in any particular choosen field.Moreover the former would gives him a lot of confusion towards the respective fields.
            Secondly, the process of broadening causes a lot of unemployment apart from developing inadequacy in the theories pertaining to his own  field. On the other hand it gives a sort of uselessness to him in his career objectives. Ofcourse it gives the broad knowledge to the individual, it creates a lot of disaster to his family members and also to the country.
            Nextly,knowledge of many academic subjects may cause loss of individuality. Moreover the development of any field depends upon the effective utilisation of the sources and their research in those fields. What it means is that the person needs to show his attitude and concentration for the  development of the selected subject. Because in the era of rapid growing technology the individual may get his identity only in his specialized field.
           Finally, for the overall development and for the well-being of the individual, one needs specialization in his respective field.This gives him ability to promote his identity even in the most unfavorable situations.",
"Lately there has been an ongoing debate over whether or not most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. Some people are of the opinion that ads represent a great opportunity for  manipulation with regard to certain products while others contend that ads cannot change the nature of the products they are presenting and are therefore not manipulative. A close examination of the issue reveals that the statement which asserts that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are is unsubstantiated.

A main reason why such a claim has its limits is the fact that the advertisement industry is regulated. The state decides about what can and can't be said in ads by  legislating about ads and competition. That makes an advertisement susceptible to lawsuits: An angry consumer who thinks that a certain ad has mislead her can sue the advertising company. Since advertising companies are aware of that, they will try not to make false claims about the products they advertise for.

Another reason why the claim about advertisements and their misleading status doesn't hold is that most ads do not actually inform about the products, but that they rather encompass certain images and emotions which are associated with the product they are trying to sell. How many ads about ice-creams include the nutrition facts? The answer is none. And since most ads do not inform anyway, it is impossible for them to make products appear better than they actually are.

Perhaps the most convincing reason why the great majority of ads is not misleading is that an appraisal of a product's quality is in most cases subjective. For instance, some people like onion soup while others hate it.  Some people would immediately switch the channel when they encounter an onion-soup-ad while others probably would enjoy watching it. So, one's perception of an advertisement undoubtedly depends on her subjective attitude toward the product. This subjective attitude would almost certainly affect the degree to which one would find the ad deceptive.

In conclusion, the claim that most ads make products seem better than they actually are is unsubstantiated for three reasons: State regulation, the advertisement's non-informative nature and the subjectivity of advertisement-appraisal.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, both young and old individuals can find fulfillment and happiness in different stages of life. 

Firstly, young people often experience a sense of freedom and possibility that older individuals may not. They are typically less burdened by responsibilities, such as family or career, and have more time to explore their interests and pursue their dreams. This sense of liberation can certainly contribute to a feeling of enjoyment. However, it is important to note that this freedom can also be a double-edged sword. Young people may struggle with uncertainty about their future and lack the experience and wisdom to navigate life's challenges. 

On the other hand, older people have the benefit of accumulated knowledge, experience, and relationships. They have weathered life's storms and learned valuable lessons along the way. This can lead to a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them, fostering a sense of contentment and appreciation for the present moment. Moreover, older individuals often have a strong support network of family and friends, providing them with a sense of belonging and purpose. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that varies greatly from person to person, regardless of age. While young people may have a certain carefree spirit, older individuals possess a wealth of wisdom and experience that can contribute to their own unique sense of fulfillment. It is therefore inaccurate to claim that one age group enjoys life more than the other. Both young and old have the potential to find happiness and meaning in their respective stages of life.",
"There are some argument wether having broad knowledge of many academic subject or specializing in one object. In case of having wide knowledge of many subjct is more benefial to most of student who have taken rather than student of who specialize one subject.

	The first of all, it mean many oppotunity that student choose their major or future. Because every student touchs many fields of subjects and.  It help student choose their specific major. If they have many chances to have, it would be happened more less to confuse their future of to change their major.  In long run, this method can save student's time and money which relocated their goal.  These experiences  will be good basis for having specific major. 

	Another reason is that broad knowledge help student in their life-time. Having many background infomantion can help many bad or good circumstances. For example, opera which student had studied in class is more attractive to them than others who never study about opera. Also others of subjuct is smilar with it.  

	Lastly, studying braod knowledge helps student to see a various aspect of subject(problem). Unluckly, students who don 't study about broad subject might have possibility to see one aspect to others. When I was young, one of my classmates was interested in math. He was also genious in math. But he didn't do well in other subjuct and had problem with peers. Becase he was not interest in other parts and peers. 
	
	Above the reasons, the best option of way of studing subject is having broade knowledge of various academic subjects.",
"In my opinion, in some situation it is better for people to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, while other specific circumstance, people need to specialize in one specific subject.

To learn knowledge form a broad part will help me to solve the problems which we will catch in any delimma. In addition to this,  it is better for people who learned many skills to find a descent job in the competitive job market.
On the other hand, If I want to fix the broken television, I need to be control professional and accurate electronic and mechanical knowledge, thus helping me to recover the television. Especially, in the part of advanced techonology area, most scientists must study in a potiential degree that  help them to create the new things. 
Different job also need the knowledge different. For a saleman, it is more than possible that they should learn a broad knowledge. If a salemae study phychology, marketing and business, it must have a big merit than other people. They can sale too many thing than the people who not know broad knowledge. But as a teacher,  they should specialize in their subject, so that they can teach students professional and accurate knowledge. But the students would be better to learn broad knowledge in the school,  they can find their interests on some subject and develop it in the future.
In conclusion, the knowledge for people whther learn broad or specific is depend on their situation. If people can control the good scale on that, they must be successful in the future.",
"I am definetly agree ....
We all love watching tv,Every time we saw the new  advertisement we get  excited at least i know my self I do...Even I do not need that stuff stilll I want to have it.I think it is  in our natura,We all same...Television  make them more desirable of course,,,,
Also I think those people they know their business, You know  what   I think that way because they are succesful,because They make the people buy  more and more,,,,
For example couple months ago I have seen some commercial on the tv.I went to shopping to the MALL.And than I  have got Whatever
I saw at tv.I took them home of course I start to use them after couple of week later  they had  so big scratch on it.(it was a cookware set)
They were not like this.When I bougth them It started after I ued them,Please listen to this on the that commercial about that stuff :It is stainles, very good    ,,,,,,,,,
Of course It was baloney,,I trusted that commercial and than I went to buy that stuff.Otherwise I would not but it.They can be tricky some time that is why We should not trust them but not that much,,,We still check them every once for a while,,,,Like   I said before  We buy something We all have  be very carefully.Otherwise sometimes our money can go for nothing.
After I had  my cookware I took them back,And than I told them,
""That is not nice,You can not take adventage of people like this""They knew I got mad.But  no  problem I could return it,I got my moey back.
Of course They asked receit, first thing,I showed it to them.
The I got back  home
 it was relief,This was lesson before I buy something I will be carefull again",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to stir intellectual curiosity. While specialization offers profound expertise in a chosen field, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This perspective stems from the inherent value of interdisciplinary thinking, the adaptability it fosters, and the enriched understanding of the world it provides.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows for interdisciplinary thinking, a crucial skill in today's interconnected world. By understanding concepts from various disciplines, individuals can connect seemingly disparate ideas, leading to innovative solutions and a more holistic perspective. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the impact of trade routes on societal development, while a scientist with an understanding of philosophy might approach ethical dilemmas in research with greater nuance.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability, a highly valued trait in a rapidly changing world. Individuals with diverse knowledge can readily navigate new challenges and embrace unfamiliar situations. For example, a graduate with a broad background in the humanities and sciences might be better equipped to transition into a career in technology, where interdisciplinary skills are increasingly sought after.
Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches one's understanding of the world. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human thought and experience. This can lead to more informed decision-making, a greater sense of empathy, and a more nuanced understanding of global issues. For instance, studying literature alongside history can provide insights into the human condition and the forces that shape societies.
In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. Interdisciplinary thinking, adaptability, and a richer understanding of the world are just some of the advantages that a diverse education offers. In an increasingly interconnected and dynamic world, embracing a broad intellectual foundation is essential for navigating the complexities of life and contributing meaningfully to society.",
"the issue at hand is that most advertisement make products seem better than tey really are.this issue is important when it comes to choosing a product.

in my opinion a lot of advertisements make products seem a lot better than they are.i believe this because advertising a product isn't usually about how good they are and what qualities it brings with it.a product needs to be sold and that's why companies need to advertise in a positive way about it in order to sell the product.for example take  a detergent to wash clothes with.this product gets compared with other dertergents,and usually the company who wants to sell this specific product  tells the consumer how much better it ist compared to its competition.the consumer might believe it and buy it,but the he finds out that it doesn' work as well how it was promised.
another reason i believe that advertisemnt doesn' always tell the truth about it's product is that there are a lot of competidors out there who might produce the same product.every producer wants his product beeing sold the most.in order to to that the costomer needs to hear a few great things about it.
on the other hand advertisement can be helpful in archievng a specific goal.for example you are in the music buisness and want your work published ,it is necessary to advertise your product in order to reach the public. someone can do this through flyers,happening events of the band and so on.this example shows that advertisement needs to tell the correct ambitions.,otherwise the consumer won't believe in this product and won't buy it in the end.
in conclusion,most advertisements though use ooverexaurration on order to get a product sold.",
"Enjoying life depends on a decision  and not on a the age or the circumstance that a person is going through. 

I have known many old people who are happier and healthier than many teenagers and adults. I know, for example, a 60-year-old woman who has more energy than two teenagers together. I might  be exaggerating, but her attitude toward life impresses me a lot. She swims every day, she goes to the beauty parlor all the weekends and she has her own business. In fact,she told me last time that she won the first place in a 2000-meter swimming competition in the Atitlan Sea. She is  also the most hyperactive person that I have ever known. She likes to joke and she is smiling everytime I look at her. 

On the other hand, I know a 30-year-old man who always wakes up tired and upset and who hates his job. When I go to visit him, he is either eating or watching Tv. I sometimes do not like to talk to him, because he is always speaking negatively. His bad attitude sometimes scares me. 

Because of this two examples given, I believe that enjoying life does not depend on someone's age. 
I am sure that the woman, whom I wrote about, wakes up every day expecting something new and that she is thankful that she has a new day to experience. She has a possitive attitude and she is the one who decides to have a special day. 

The other man could have a terrible job and a terrible house, but if he wants and decides to make of them something pleasant and enjoyable, he will make a paradise out of it. 

It conclusion, I disagree with the statement. Happiness depends on the person's attitude and decisions.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a fallacy to assume that older individuals are incapable of experiencing profound joy and fulfillment. In fact, life experiences, wisdom, and a deeper understanding of oneself often contribute to a richer and more meaningful existence in later years. 

Firstly, older people have the advantage of accumulated life experiences. They have witnessed both triumphs and setbacks, learned from their mistakes, and developed a resilience that comes with time. This perspective allows them to appreciate the present moment more fully, recognizing the preciousness of each day. For instance, a retired teacher who has dedicated their life to educating young minds might find immense satisfaction in spending time with their grandchildren, sharing their knowledge and creating lasting memories. 

Secondly, older individuals often prioritize their well-being and pursue activities that bring them genuine happiness. They have the freedom to explore their passions, whether it be traveling the world, pursuing hobbies, or simply spending quality time with loved ones. This sense of autonomy and self-discovery can lead to a profound sense of contentment and joy. A retired artist, for example, might finally have the time and resources to dedicate themselves fully to their craft, experiencing a deep sense of fulfillment through their creative expression. 

In conclusion, while youth may be characterized by a certain exuberance and lack of responsibility, it is a mistake to assume that older people are incapable of enjoying life. Life experiences, wisdom, and a deeper understanding of oneself contribute to a richer and more meaningful existence in later years. Older individuals have the opportunity to prioritize their well-being, pursue their passions, and appreciate the present moment with a newfound perspective. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for various causes, from environmental protection to social justice. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led climate change protests, amplified by social media, demonstrates their commitment to addressing global issues. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work, often focusing on areas that resonate with their interests and skills. From mentoring underprivileged children to organizing blood donation drives, they actively contribute to local communities. Many schools and universities also encourage community service, providing opportunities for students to gain valuable experience while making a difference. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms. Young people may not always engage in traditional volunteer activities, but their contributions can be equally valuable. For example, young entrepreneurs who create businesses that benefit their communities or artists who use their talents to raise awareness about social issues are also contributing to the betterment of society. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact on the world around them. Their commitment to community service, often expressed in innovative and impactful ways, deserves recognition and support.",

This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various avenues. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change activism, exemplified by Greta Thunberg's movement, showcases their dedication to environmental sustainability. These young individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices to advocate for change. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to benefit their communities. Many young entrepreneurs are launching businesses that create jobs and contribute to local economies. Others are using their technological expertise to develop innovative solutions for social problems. For example, the development of mobile applications that connect volunteers with community needs demonstrates the ingenuity and social consciousness of young people. 

Finally, young people are actively engaged in online activism and social media campaigns. Through online platforms, they raise awareness about important issues, mobilize support for causes, and encourage others to take action. The recent surge in online campaigns advocating for social justice and equality highlights the power of young people to influence public opinion and drive change.

"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers profound expertise in a chosen field, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This perspective stems from the inherent interconnectedness of knowledge, the fostering of critical thinking, and the development of a well-rounded individual.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows for a deeper understanding of the world. Subjects like history, literature, and philosophy provide context for scientific advancements, while the arts and humanities offer insights into human behavior and societal structures. This interconnectedness fosters a holistic perspective, enabling individuals to see the bigger picture and draw connections between seemingly disparate fields. For instance, understanding the historical context of scientific discoveries can shed light on their motivations and implications.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. Exposure to diverse perspectives and methodologies from various disciplines encourages individuals to question assumptions, analyze information critically, and form well-informed opinions. This ability to think critically is essential in navigating the complexities of the modern world, where information is readily available but often unreliable.
Finally, a broad knowledge base contributes to a well-rounded individual. Engaging with diverse subjects fosters intellectual curiosity, expands horizons, and enhances communication skills. Individuals with a broad education are better equipped to engage in meaningful conversations, appreciate different cultures, and adapt to changing circumstances.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and rewarding educational experience. It fosters a holistic understanding of the world, cultivates critical thinking skills, and contributes to the development of a well-rounded individual. By embracing the interconnectedness of knowledge, we can unlock a deeper appreciation for the complexities of our world and become more informed and adaptable citizens.",
"""It is all about the club, makes your shot have a lifetime expirience""(wilson golf clubs) this was an advertisment for a golf club about five years ago. Why do I mention it? well I bought their product. In the modern world that we live in advertisment and marketing are everything inside a free market. Adverstisment is an important factor used by producers to sell their products, it makes the consumer become interested in the product and makes him most of the times buy it.

	  Bringing my previose quote again what I tried to show with it is that by just listening to a propaganda and its advertisment I became so interested in that club that I finally bought it. I was young and just becoming a part of a famouse hobby called golf. I wasnt aware of what brands were the best and so. So I just bought the one that called the most my attention ""Wilson golf clubs."" It had a great advertisnment wich assured me that its product will last foreever and that it will make my game improve as a whole. One year later it boke leaving me with no more than a memory. I asked myself why?

	Well in the business world companies want revenue for greater profits. One way of gaining it is by the means of advertising. If you have a firm that sells shoes who is just beign introduced to the market you imidiatly want money, through advertisment you can trick the consumer into buying youre shoes because they are top quality and they will never get old nor loose their power. Through this mean of business you can expand in the market and the only one who could get hurt is youre client with your crapppy product.

	The world is filled with advertisment cartels and so. We people need to be aware that what we are buying has a good quality because most of the times things arent why they seem nor said to be.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements accurately portray products, many tend to exaggerate their benefits, making them seem far more appealing than they truly are. This tendency to embellish reality is a common practice employed by advertisers to capture attention and drive sales. 

One compelling example of this phenomenon is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing and photo editing in beauty advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve flawless skin, perfect proportions, and unrealistic features. This manipulation creates an unattainable standard of beauty, leading consumers to believe that the advertised products can transform their appearance in a similar manner. However, the reality is that these products rarely deliver on such extravagant promises. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on persuasive language and emotional appeals to create a sense of urgency and desirability. Phrases like ""limited-time offer"" or ""exclusive deal"" can trigger a fear of missing out, prompting consumers to make impulsive purchases. Additionally, advertisements frequently associate products with positive emotions, such as happiness, success, or freedom, implying that using these products will lead to a more fulfilling life. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the actual functionality and value of the product. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately represent products, it is evident that many engage in deceptive practices to enhance their appeal. The use of exaggerated claims, misleading imagery, and emotional manipulation creates a distorted perception of reality, leading consumers to believe that products are far superior to their actual capabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to approach advertisements with a critical eye and to rely on independent reviews and personal experiences to form informed purchasing decisions.",
"The statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they are in reality is very true.
When I am watching TV at home and get to know new advertisements I ignore it. If products would be as good as the advertisements promise them to be people would only buy products of which they have seen an advertisement.
For example there are only stars that advertise for a product when you watch TV. Alone this fact shows that advertisements manipulate the watcher. Of course there are products which you see on TV that are really good in reality but most of the products are not as good as you think they have to be when you see them on TV.
The producers of a new product have to think very well about what kind of advertisement would be the best for there product.
Concerns pay millions of dollars in order to produce a new advertisement clip on TV in order to increase the number of sol products. If that wouldn't work they would not spend such sums of money. Of course the number of sold products also depends on whether the product is really good or not.
I think that it is better to compare products or to to ask people which product they prefer instead of convincing on a supermodel that that is just enjoying an ice cream on TV.
But there have to be people that are believing everything that is told on TV, radio or in some magazines and those people make that the concerns benefit with their advertisements.
Personally I believe in the experiences I made and decide if I take aspecial pizza once more or if I should choose another one the next time. Advertisements don't have any influences on me.
As a conclusion I think that only few products are as good as actors ensure in advertisements because I was nearly everytime disappointed when I bought a product that I admired on TV.
Perhaps I have had always bad luck.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to account for the diverse experiences and perspectives of individuals across age groups. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibilities, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than older individuals is an oversimplification. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and multifaceted. What brings joy to a young person, such as attending parties or pursuing adventurous hobbies, may hold little appeal to an older person who values different experiences, such as spending time with family, pursuing intellectual interests, or simply enjoying the quiet moments of reflection. 

Moreover, older individuals often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and have learned to appreciate the subtle joys that come with age. They may have overcome significant challenges, built meaningful relationships, and achieved personal milestones that contribute to a sense of fulfillment and contentment. 

Furthermore, the notion that younger people are inherently happier is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that happiness levels tend to fluctuate throughout the lifespan, with peaks and valleys at different ages. While young people may experience a surge of happiness during their formative years, older individuals often report higher levels of life satisfaction and emotional well-being.
In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic and inaccurate generalization. While youth may possess certain advantages, such as physical energy and a sense of possibility, older individuals have their own unique experiences and perspectives that contribute to their enjoyment of life. Ultimately, happiness and fulfillment are subjective experiences that vary greatly from person to person, regardless of age.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products and services. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them appear far superior to their actual capabilities. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to purchase. 

One compelling example of this exaggeration is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing in beauty advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve flawless skin, perfect proportions, and unrealistic features. This manipulation creates an unattainable standard of beauty, leading consumers to feel inadequate and more likely to purchase products that promise to achieve this idealized look. Similarly, food advertisements often employ techniques like close-up shots and vibrant colors to make dishes appear more appetizing than they truly are. The reality is that the food we see in these ads is often styled and manipulated to enhance its visual appeal, leading to disappointment when we attempt to recreate the dish at home. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, advertisers can create a positive association with their products, even if the product itself is not particularly exceptional. For instance, a car commercial might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that purchasing the car will bring similar joy and adventure. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the actual features and functionality of the product, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based on feelings rather than facts. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately reflect the qualities of products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits to entice consumers. The use of airbrushing, emotional appeals, and other persuasive techniques creates a distorted perception of reality, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based on unrealistic expectations. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"Today young people do not think about helping their communities in terms of many dimensions. Youth starts to omit the requirements of the people in the society. The humanity has never lived such a individualistic problem before.
  Firstly, the life has begun to be harder recently. People have to acquire a good job to survive. Young people have to battle with hard life conditions in last decades. They want to be educated in high qualified colleges, so they have to work hard to approach this goal, This causes a time consuming problem in their lifes, so they spend their energy in school life mostly.

"In the present, general young people do not want to participate in their community. I storngly belive that if one helps their community, he certainly has lots of advantages. 

Helping community brings various beneficts to us. of course , the behavior that support community doesn't give vast positive things. however the advantage of helping community can eclipse their disadvanges. Moltly community can give financial aids to the poor effectively and they  support for discarding negative aspects of society more fast and useful than individual person trying to decrease the rate of negative aspects of society. Hence if one gives helping to community, obviously  he can add power to community and he is able to affect positive things to his socitey effectively. 

A community provides lots of experience to someone that participate in the community. because a community creates events that help to increase positive quality of society. for example , they support varied aids to minor people. they send community members to minor people for giving the hope of living. so if one is component of the community, he should take in lots of helping events. so he can experience lots of valuable things.  

Helping the community contains lots of valuable things. therefore it is recommend for young people to give eoungh time to helping their communities",
"I disagree this idea that young people nowadays do not help communities. I support this idea for specific reason.

  I wathed TV proglam last week, and that proglam is about volunteer activity. I saw many college students were doing volunteer on TV. The students support elderly people. These elderly people experienced World War 2, and the students want to listen these elderly's talk about war they have never experienced before.  By making good relationship with these elderly, the young people try to understand  their sadness, and they try to find the meaning of peace. They said,""We don't know war, and we feel we are living in peaceful country, but there are still many wars around the world, and people killing, and dying more and more.. We think young people should learn from war-experienced people more than text book. ""  

  I'm also belong volunteer club which is  teaching Japanese to foreigners.  Many of them are kids, and they came Japan because their parents came Japan to find thier job. In Japan, salary is much higher than developping country. Of course they can not speak japanese, so their children can not keep up with japanese students. Even more, they often teased and descriminated by their friends.They need help.

"I think each age has its plasure times and memories. during the childhood, teens years, young people & old

      During childhood you have the chance to do anything and no one will say why ? they will say he is trying to learn, let him try it so he will know what is it like drink a hot cup of tea he will cray becouse he did not know its hot, what is hot? so next time he will avoid it and when he cray his Mom and Dad will run to him and huge him. He will have all the interisting. He will buy toys, games and tudybears. He will sleep with his mother and father.

      Teens and yong people usully have the most good times they enjoy the most becose they will start to under stand everything, try everything if they have the corige (brave heart) for the bunji jumping, scopa diving, have alots of frineds, join a collage, drive the cars, lots and lots of enteristing things which old people can do it but not like young people. old people spicelly when they retier they like to go in a croze or in a trip around the world, but the acttivities that they will had are not the same of the youngs. Young people have cornucopia of fun,experiens, friends. the butiy being old is to see your son or dughetr having a buby, to see his smill, to see your old wife/husben beside you smileing to you graping your hand.

     I think young people have a wild life but when they become old they have lots of love. The most important is to know how to live each period correctly .

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's horizons is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters a more well-rounded individual, equipped with critical thinking skills and the ability to connect diverse ideas. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows for a more holistic understanding of the world. By exploring different disciplines, individuals gain a wider perspective on complex issues. For instance, studying history alongside economics provides a deeper understanding of the factors that shape economic systems. Similarly, understanding the principles of biology can shed light on the ethical implications of technological advancements in medicine. This interconnectedness of knowledge fosters a more nuanced and informed worldview. 

Secondly, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. By encountering diverse perspectives and methodologies, individuals learn to analyze information critically, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This ability to think critically is essential in navigating the complexities of modern society, where information is readily available but often unreliable. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base opens doors to a wider range of career opportunities. In today's rapidly evolving job market, adaptability and versatility are highly valued. Individuals with a broad education are better equipped to adapt to changing demands and explore diverse career paths. For example, a background in humanities can complement a technical degree, providing valuable communication and problem-solving skills. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more enriching and adaptable approach to learning. By exploring diverse subjects, individuals develop a holistic understanding of the world, cultivate critical thinking skills, and enhance their career prospects. Therefore, I firmly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",

"I agree with that ""It is better to have borad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject."" because if I have a lot of broad knowledge I can use everywhere in the test or exam.

I agree with that because if they have broad knowledge of many academic subjects they can understand that what is going on here and what is going to happening here now. They will not lose because it is good to have broad knowledge it is like general knowldge even I can use in the test or in exam if they ask to me that about world or anything that about general knowledge or broad knowledge of many academic.

I think if they do not have broad knowledge or general knowledgeof many academic, they will be stupid because if they do not know about anything, tyey can not do anything for example in japan, if they want to go to that unvercity they have to write exam and if they pass that exam they can go that univercity but for that exam is really hard because that univercity's exam will ask to them about for example what is happening in USA's gavernment and ect so which mean is that if they do not have any of general knowledge or broad knowledge of many academic they will not pass forever. 

If they want to have general knowledge or broad knowledge of many academic, they do not have to study to know this, they have to do is that just read the newspaper or watch the news everyday than they will have general knowledge or broad knowledge of many many academic but they must continue they must not stop it otherwise they will not get any of them.

So as you can see that if they have general knowledge or broad knowledge if many academic subjects it is good to have tham and it is not wasting time. So if they want to get tham just read the newspaper and watch the news every single day not like once a week than they will get a lot of things in thier head and stick on their head so they never ever forget them.",
"Nowdays people use advertisement  to show their product; or to commercialize it; but  usualy they push much more on these advertisement. I mean they show their item pretier or say something that's not true about it.
I  think  that's abuzing on costumers  trust.
Example : when you are usig a phone card  the time remaining is generaly less than they said.
Another example is car; the preformance they said about it is false.
So as costumer i agee with the statement, and i think people should   take time to make a right choice before buying their items.
And campanies should show the right side of their productions.",
"I agree with the statement: 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do', although it was not such an easy question and furtermore it has neither an easy or definitive answer.
I believe that some (some, because it is impossible to generallyze in abstract themes as this one) young people enjoy life more than older people mostly because they have less responsabilities. As it is said: 'Those whom don't know anything, don't fear anything' which means that the less you know the less you have to worry about.  By example, a six year old boy needs to be feed and he worries about it when he feels hungry, buy he doesn't worry about who is bringing the money home to buy the food. So, he enjoys life by being satisfied on his basic needs and by being able to play and experience life at this young stage. 
On the other hand, older people, adults for example, generally have an income, they have money, they drive, they have an active social life and they can practically  do whatever they want... this, gives them a sense of freedom. 
I said before that this was not an easy question and either it was not easy to answer because it has many points to be anallyzed, so many that I believe it could be the topic of a professional research. There are many variables: what can we consider as young people (teenagers are a young segment of the population and they certainly don't feel happy alll the time) and what can be considered as old people (Very old people are most of the time sick; according to Jose Saramago: the old people lives going to nothing while the young people goes for everything). 
But,  in conclusion I think that is better to know many things, to be aware of what life has for each one -you can reach this state when you are an adult, even a young adult- and then enjoy life, knowing the advantages and challenges that life puts on your way to get almost anything: when something costs one a lot of work, it will appear to be better when it is obtained. 
So that: I am older than other people and I enjoy life more than some younger people.",
"Although young people tend to have more energy to do something than older people do, I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people. There are two reasons for this:money and experiences.
     To bigin with,the old people usually have more money than young people have. This means older have more opptions to do something than younger. For instance, when we want to travel somewhere, the panphlets of travel for senior tend to be costly than those for family or young people.This is becouse, the older have tendency to eat better dishes or ride on more comfortable vheicles. However, in general, young people focus on the cost. We can also this tendency in panphlets of travel.This shows that  the older can more flexible how to spend their money and how to select their plans.
     Next, older people have more expereinces than younger people which are based on the long life time. Therefore, older people have less possibility to make wrong dicision. For example, when we can't decide which way to choose about something, we are often consulted by older. This is because, if we decide wrong way,
sometimes we recieve inconvenience. This means that older poeple can avoid such inconvenience by their own judgement.
     For these reasons, I take issue with the idea that young people lead more enjoyable life than old people. Each group of people can enjoy their life as their own way.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and amplifying their impact. For example, the recent surge in online activism surrounding environmental issues demonstrates the power of young people to drive change through digital platforms. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work and community organizations. From volunteering at local soup kitchens and animal shelters to participating in environmental cleanup projects and mentoring programs, they are actively contributing to the well-being of their communities. Many schools and universities also encourage community service, fostering a sense of civic responsibility among students. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms. Young people may not always engage in traditional volunteer activities, but they contribute to their communities in other ways. For instance, starting a local business, organizing community events, or simply being a good neighbor can all be considered forms of community service. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact on the world around them. It's important to recognize and celebrate their efforts, rather than dismissing them as apathetic or disengaged.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, creating an idealized image that often fails to reflect reality. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a car advertisement might showcase its sleek design and powerful engine, but it might fail to mention its poor fuel efficiency or unreliable safety features. This selective presentation creates a distorted perception of the product, making it seem more desirable than it truly is. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and persuasive language to manipulate consumers. They use catchy slogans, celebrity endorsements, and evocative imagery to evoke feelings of desire, excitement, or even envy. These emotional triggers can cloud consumers' judgment and make them more susceptible to purchasing products that they may not actually need or want. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous model in a luxurious setting, suggesting that using the product will make the consumer feel equally sophisticated and desirable. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may provide accurate information, the majority tend to present a distorted and idealized view of products. By selectively highlighting positive aspects, employing emotional appeals, and using persuasive language, advertisers create a perception that often fails to match reality. Consumers should be aware of these tactics and exercise critical thinking when evaluating advertising messages.",
"In universities, the students study lots of thing related with their subject. However, they can not make relation between their subjects and the other subjects. In my opinion, we have to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, because we can make a relation between our subject and the other subjects and we can think more widely.
         First of all, students should know have knowledge about the many subjects because they can find something from the the other subject related with their subject. The other subject can give us an idea about our subject because they may have a relation. For instance, today, the researchers work on projects which contain lost of subjects because they think that they can only find the result of the problems from the relationship of the subjects, so they want to learn lots of things about the other subjects. As a result, the students should know nroad knowledge ofm any acedemic subjects to solve the problems on their projects.
           Secondly, many academic subjects gain us to think more widely. if we have knowledge about the other subjects we can analyze the problems more easily because we can search more subjects to solve the problem. For instance, although my teacher is a professor, he is still study lots of thing because he think that he can think more widely if he know lots of thing about the other subjects, so he can easily find the solution if they are related with his problem, 
as a result, broad knowledge of many academic subjects make us to see the solution more easily. 
            In conclusion , we can think frem the other sides and make a relation with the problem. as a result, p",
"In my opinion it is better to study all subject regarding his academics then only in one subject ,which offers better career.
even though ther is chance that many things will be confusion and the less things will be much effective and also we will have good job if we are good at the subject.Unless we will be effective in all the subject any body will not get good jobs.
Having broad knowledge it will also use full in daily purpose for example if he doesnot  know any thing about science that regarding to the medicens then for every small sake he should go the hospital  for regular checkup.But if have some what knowledge about the science we can able to solve the simple problems.
If we have knowledge in many subject it will have its own adventages we wil get good jobs and also we will have good career and will be well settled.But unless we will have prefect knowledge in al lthe subject  we will not settled for example if a person whoes specilisation is communication he should have software knowledge also why bacause it will provide much jobs and we will be verry use full  inorder to well settled.
And also if the person is well in only one subject if ther areless  jobs then how can he get good job has there are no jobs regarding that subject ,so it is better to have knowledge in all academic subject then in only one subject   
So it is better to have broad subject knowledge then only in one suject.",
"I'm not agree with that affermation.
I have a grand-pa, 85 years old. And he is planning to go with me in the north of Europe, for watching the ice-berg, next summer.  he would like to do that with his big old car, and doing this big trip along the Europe, alone ,with only his grand-child, 18 years old. He is ,for sure, a person that is enjoying his life.
I know also people, that are in the best part of theire life and that love to stay in front of the tv,playing with the Play-station, waiting to became old.
We usually link young people to the energy, when I think about a baby,i think life, movement and when i think about an old person i think something slow, unlively.  Because that is the stereotype.   Since the ancient times the young people where the people in the spring of theire lives, unlike the old people that where in the winter of theire lifes.
But now I don't think that that is true anymore. If people want to feel alive inside, they can do that at all the age that they want. 
I know a person in India, she is really old. and the last time that a friend of mine went to visit her in her country, she asked to that friend to prepare some casset with word in italian, because she would like to learn Italian. Is not that amazing? 
She has more than 80 years old, and she want to find the energy to learn Italian, and maybe one day visit our country. That is something that stimulate me a lot. 
To be young or to be old, at this time, it is not depending on the age of the person but it depends only on how a person feel like.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute to their communities. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits over communal involvement, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to making a positive impact. 

One compelling example of young people's commitment to their communities is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local food drives and environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice issues, young people are taking the lead in addressing pressing societal concerns. The recent surge in youth activism, exemplified by movements like Black Lives Matter and Fridays for Future, demonstrates a generation that is passionate about creating change and actively working towards a better future.
Furthermore, many young people contribute to their communities through volunteer work. From mentoring underprivileged children to assisting elderly individuals with daily tasks, young volunteers provide invaluable support to those in need. These acts of kindness and compassion not only benefit the recipients but also foster a sense of purpose and belonging among the youth.
In conclusion, while it may be tempting to stereotype young people as apathetic towards community involvement, the reality is far more nuanced. Countless young individuals are actively engaged in making a difference in their communities through various initiatives and volunteer work. Their commitment to creating a positive impact is a testament to their generation's desire to build a better future for all.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial, fostering adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's rapidly evolving world, careers and industries are constantly shifting. Having a diverse understanding of various subjects allows individuals to readily transition into new fields and tackle challenges from multiple perspectives. For instance, a historian with a strong understanding of economics might be better equipped to analyze historical events than someone solely focused on historical narratives. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking skills. By exposing oneself to different disciplines, one develops the ability to analyze information from various angles, identify biases, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking is essential in navigating the complexities of modern life, from evaluating political discourse to making informed decisions about personal health. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base allows for a more holistic understanding of the world. Interdisciplinary connections reveal the interconnectedness of different fields and provide a richer understanding of complex issues. For example, studying literature alongside environmental science can offer a deeper appreciation for the impact of human actions on the natural world. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world, preparing individuals for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",
"When people think of making an advertisement for any kind of purpose, they always want to make consumers to get the right idea, or at least understand it. For this purpose to function, the advertisement has to be perfect. So, it may be true that adevertisements make products look better than they really are, although that doesn't mean the product is bad.

The purpose for advertisement is to sell, or to change ways of thinking in peoples mind. An easy example, is fast food restaurants. They will never give a product as good as it appears in menu, but you will still buy it. This means that since the moment you leave that restaurant, you will always now that the meal you had will not look like he one in the menu. Still the restaurant will keep on adevertising their new meals or new promotions in the street or in their menu's to create a confussion on the costumers mind, but make them think that the meal looks exactly as it is in the adevertisement. 

If advertisements were not as perfect as they are today, they would not sell. The point is to make people decide for something that they may no be convinced for. So, if the advertisement shows the perfect way for people to get convinced for something, why not make them better than they really are. 

This may create problems also, because you can loose clients everytime you give them something that is not what they expected, but as I said at the beginning the advetisement can be better than the real product, but it doesn't mean that the prodcut is bad. Maybe the client can no be as satisfied at the beginning but if the company tries its best apart of the advertisement to make the costumer think the product is good, this one will forget how the advertisement looked like. 

In conlusion, the advertisement is a part of a strategy to sell products, but it is the first one to be seen by future custumers. This means that its good to make them better than they really are, but there has to be a good job to satisfy the client in the moment of purchase and the moment of atending the cliente so the product will never be a bad product, although it seems better in the advertisement.",
"In my point of view I completely disagree with the statement ""young people enjoy life more than older people do"". In my country, everyone enjoys life as much as possible and for them they do not care about their age. For them age is just a number; they think that the spirit that is within themselves is what matters. So they enjoy their lives to its maximum in any period of time. And so, do i.

     Besides, everyone has many goals, and one of them is to enjoy life. So no matter what age you are you can enjoy life. For instance a child could be thinking that he is enjoying life when he/she is playing with his/her friends, now let's see a old person having a vacation on the Bahamas spending his/her time with the person that he/she loves. In my point of view, both people, the child and the old person are enjoying life, and i do not see why would one of them enjoy life more than the other.

     As i said before everyone has a spirit and i personally do not think that the spirit get older as the days pass by. Within one's spirit there is energy. Energy is what takes us from one place to another; to eat or not to eat; to do things or not to things; to enjoy life or not to enjoy life. So then, if everyone has a spirit that means that they also have energy, therefore everyone has an equal amount of energy to enjoy life at any period of time. To put in other words, age does not matter for someone to enjoy life.

     In conclusion, young people do not enjoy life more than older people do because we are all the same. It is true that when you get older the muscles start to be more flexible and solf and tends to break more easily than if you were young. But muscles do not have anything to do with enjoying life. It is also true that as you get older, your brains develops in different steps and so you can think more deeply about things that interest or bother you. But does that affect whether you enjoy life more than others?. Well, in my opinion my answer would be no.",
"Because of the importance of advertisements in our modern society, this question seems quite interesting and could be also written this way : Do advertisements lie to us?
It always seems to us that the goods we see on TV or in magazines are perfect, or far better than they actually are, and we are often disappointed by the real products once we have bought it.
But could an advertisement work if he told us that what he wants us to buy is only quite good or not that bad? Advertisements are closer to propaganda than information and it can't be helped.
On an other hand, some advertisements are willing to give some results or marks that their products were given by different organisations, associations or consumers and we're eager to believe that, most of the time.
We mustn't forget that customers are usually well protected by laws which punish lies in advertisements but here isn't the problem.
Indeed, the problem is that people usually don't make any differences between the picture and the thing itself, and are too eager to think that what they see just in front of them is real and ideal. They always look for something perfect but can't realise that perfection doesn't exist, moreover low-cost perfection.
Advertisements show us the best sides of what they want to be baught and it couldn't be an other way, we can't blame it for that and furthermore we should face our own responsabilities by training to be more critical and careful in our decisions.
The fact is that advertisements don't make products seem far better than they really are because only the consumer see what is beautiful, it's a kind of game with the consumer who stay the only one to decide if he actually like, need or want.",
"The ubiquitous nature of advertising in our modern world makes it hard to escape the allure of products presented as the solution to all our desires. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many employ persuasive techniques to make products seem much better than they really are. This exaggeration, often achieved through selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals, can mislead consumers and ultimately lead to dissatisfaction. 

One common tactic used by advertisers is to focus solely on the positive aspects of a product, while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For example, a commercial for a weight-loss product might showcase individuals achieving dramatic transformations in a short period, without mentioning the rigorous exercise and dietary changes required for such results. This selective presentation creates an unrealistic expectation that the product alone can deliver miraculous outcomes. 

Furthermore, advertisements often employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, they associate these positive emotions with the product, making it seem more desirable. A commercial for a luxury car, for instance, might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that purchasing the car will bring similar joy and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can cloud consumers' judgment and lead them to make impulsive decisions based on feelings rather than facts. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may provide accurate information, many rely on deceptive tactics to make products appear more appealing than they truly are. By selectively presenting information, employing emotional appeals, and creating unrealistic portrayals, advertisers can mislead consumers and ultimately lead to dissatisfaction. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these techniques and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",

"When people imagine about young people's lives, they think active and joyful lives, so I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. 
 Young people usually tend to try something new. In other words, they feel excited about an event that they have never experienced before no matter how hard it is. However, majority of older people do not want to try something fresh because they already feel comfortable with their ordinary life. Even though they are bored with their circumstances, they normally do not have desire for more interesting life. Last christmas, I met my grandmother. When I suggested going on a trip to wherever she wants to go, she seemed she was not enthusiastic about the plan,obviously contrary to me, so I asked her the reason for her feeling. Then, she said that she felt exhausted enough and all she wanted to stay at home rather than travel. At that moment, I could realize all the seniors like my grandmother desire more comfort and rest. 
 The other reason is that young people are provided much more experiences from the society. For example, when teenagers graduate from their high schools, they eventually enter the university. And, in the university, there are plenty of clubs that they can get involved. Thus, through variety of clubs they experience, they can find their intersts and feel pleased. Older people, on the other hand, do not receive many opportunities from their circumstances because they usually stay at home or go only several places where they use to go daily. Although these places can provide them convenience, they cannot give them a chance to try various kind of activities. Therefore, the older people undergo much less experience than young people.
 As a result, the young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people try to find something new and they experience variety of opportunities more than older people do.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has been debated for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When exposed to diverse perspectives and disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify patterns, and draw connections between seemingly disparate fields. This holistic approach allows for more creative solutions and a deeper understanding of complex issues. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the causes of historical events, while a scientist with a background in literature might be more adept at communicating their research findings.
Secondly, a broad education cultivates adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's interconnected society, individuals are constantly encountering new challenges and opportunities. A broad knowledge base equips them with the flexibility to navigate these changes, learn new skills, and adapt to evolving demands. For example, a person with a broad understanding of technology, business, and communication might be better prepared to transition between different careers or industries.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and adaptable learning experience. It fosters critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and adaptability, preparing individuals for the complexities and uncertainties of the modern world. By embracing a diverse range of knowledge, we can become more well-rounded individuals, better equipped to contribute to society and thrive in a constantly evolving landscape.",
"We all are familiar with the phrase 'Knowledge is power'.Which is indeed a truth in itself as knowlege af any kind nerver lets you down when you are in a crunch situation.Therefore I agree that it is better to have knowledge of many subjects as its makes an individual intellectually sound and imparts in him the quality of decision making.

It can be a good option  to specialize in one specific subject if one is really interested in any reasearch activity but otherwise it should be diversed and should consists many interesting topics within his selected course and also have some general subjects like arts,ecology,biology etc.It helps individual to be more powerful in this competetive world.In order to survive in this world one should have a quality to adapt to any situation and that is only possible if he has a  chance to navigate  through the vast ocean of knowledge.

I can give my own example.I had a subject in highschool name scoteer-motor cycle repairing.It was an optional subject which taught me some basics of how to service our bikes,how to maintain them.The advantage now I am having that I can service my own bike free of cost.It also helps me in keeoping by bike in good condition.So we can see that the subject which seemed to have no weightage in my acedemaics rather helped me in my future to save money, which is indeed a requirement of the time for me now.

So we can conclude that no knowledge goes waste.Somewhere sometime in our life we may require to use the knowledge which was learnt just as a formality in the classrooms.So its better to be prepared for our life with vast knowledge from broad knowledge rather than having a approach of getting limited common-sense knowledge by learning specific subjects.",
"I agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. 
There are two reasons.
First, if you have acquired broad knowledge of many academic subjects while you were a student, it would help you to chose your future job. If the job you want to have needs specialized knowledge you will be able to study in one specific subject. 
Second, if you have broad knowledge, it enables to cope with a lot of situation in real society.
For these reasons, I agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of products, I strongly disagree and believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks, creating an idealized image that often does not align with reality. 

One of the primary ways advertisements mislead consumers is through the use of selective information. They often highlight only the most positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential downsides. For instance, a commercial for a weight loss product might showcase a slim and toned individual, but fail to mention the rigorous exercise regimen and strict dietary restrictions required to achieve such results. This selective presentation creates a false impression of ease and effectiveness, leading consumers to make unrealistic expectations. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ persuasive language and imagery to evoke emotional responses. They use catchy slogans, appealing visuals, and celebrity endorsements to create a sense of desire and urgency. This emotional appeal can overshadow rational decision-making, prompting consumers to purchase products based on fleeting feelings rather than objective needs. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous woman surrounded by admirers, implying that wearing the fragrance will make the user equally alluring. This association of the product with positive emotions can lead consumers to overlook its actual scent or price. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often present a distorted picture of reality. By selectively highlighting positive attributes, employing emotional appeals, and using misleading imagery, most advertisements create an idealized version of products that rarely matches the actual experience. Consumers must be aware of these tactics and engage in critical thinking before making purchasing decisions.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks, making products appear far more appealing than they truly are. This tendency is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to purchase. 

One compelling example of this exaggeration is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing and photo editing in beauty advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve unrealistic standards of beauty, creating an unattainable ideal that can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction among consumers. Similarly, food advertisements often employ techniques like close-ups and strategically placed lighting to make dishes appear more appetizing than they are in reality. These visual manipulations can mislead consumers into believing that the product will deliver an experience that is far removed from the actual taste and texture. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals and persuasive language to create a sense of urgency or desirability. For instance, commercials for weight loss products often feature testimonials from individuals who claim to have achieved dramatic results, even though these claims may be unsubstantiated. By tapping into consumers' desires for quick fixes and instant gratification, these advertisements can create a false sense of hope and encourage impulsive purchases. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can provide valuable information about products, it is important to recognize that they are primarily designed to sell. By employing techniques that exaggerate benefits and downplay drawbacks, most advertisements create an idealized image of products that often fails to reflect reality. As discerning consumers, we must be aware of these tactics and critically evaluate the information presented to us before making purchasing decisions.",
"I really agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertising emphasizes the qualities of a product, or simply change it. Few cases exist of a product being advertised as the worst one in order to be sold

Emphasizing the qualities of a product is the natural way people working in the advertising industry use to sell their products. This is based on the assumption that the better the product appears, the most likely people are be to buy it. Imagine that an advertisement shows a car which is just the reflect of the reality, that is to say, going to the car repair after breakdown, buying expensive gas to make it run : people would not buy it as the disadvantages of having car would be too important. 

That is why advertisements insist on the mechanical performances of cars such as the acceleration rate or the low consumption, which are positive value for people, but highly biased. In general the reality is far lower than the advertisememt. The advertised car is being driven in an ideal world in straigth line with no traffic jams. That is so surprising when you are finally aware of the real consumption rate in  our today's life.

Adverstisements can also tells false arguments in order to give the product a defined image that fits people's needs. It sells qualities that are not the ones of the product. For example fast-food restaurant advertise on the nutritional qualities of their products althougth this kind of food is recognized to contain high rates of grease and sugar. 

So in general this is sure that  most advertisements improve the product itself because this is the aim of advertisements. I know one case of a product being sold as the worst one : this is called ""ugly fruits"" which are fruits with no standardized shapes like those we find in supermarkets. They do not look good. But even behind this there is a positive and emphasized message : uglier the fruits are , the more natural and healthier, even if those fruits have no more nitrituinal virtues.  Even ugliness could make seem product better.",
"It`s quite common to hear judgment about young people nowadays. It`s even quite popular the idea that they are poor in spirit and too selfish to spend time on someone else life.
Well, I think It`s the way adults use to solve some their internal problems, completely not tied with what the reality is.
The reality is that young people nowadays spend much more time to helping their community than before, and I think this habits will increase in the future.
The modern life has brougth us to stress our time in order to do as much as we can: or better, in order to earn as much as we can. This behaviur entay an important aspect: the rising of a new concept of common culture. What I want to say is that now every young people is enough preperred to understand that is better to work and to make efforts for the community instead of behaving selfishly.Any good action can only improve the common happyness, but our happyness is just inside this commonwealth.
It`s even more and more evident how young people are trying destroy old stereotypes of thinking about what is defferent. Although until few years ago hostile behaviours among human races were deep radicated in common thinking, new social dynamics are strongly addressing young people to accept every kind of difference. Thus making easier and faster the growing of a new common sense of belonging to a community; and it`s this new sense of belonging to make us spend more time with this new family.
Anyway the elevate number of young people involved in volunteer group, such as medical team in poor area of the word or even very young people helping in housekeeping elders, is a confirm of what I`ve stated.
In conclusion, I can even well understand why many adults think that most of young people ar poor in sprit: are not them to teach us in university classes that yhe only god we must pray is money? And the only way to earn money isn`t time?",
"Those who dose  belive that younge people spent very much time to do for their communities. However, I might say that young people recently do not give enough time to  taking care of the sociey which they belongs. There are several resons : to spent their own time for their future and to share time with peers. 
  First of all, young people are supposed to spent their own time for their future. You might say that young people want to spent time to do something for their communities. However, you may not deny that it is critical for them to develop their ability for their future. As society is getting more complex, the required ablility to survive in the dog-eat-dog society is more complicated.  Therefore, the role of young people has been changed. It was to consider other peole and  their communities but now it is to concentrate for own achivement and success life in the future. 
  Moreover, young people  want to share time with peers. By  being with peers, they can feel comfortable and have fun with similar interest stuff. They enable not only  to coperate with friends for some project and   but also to become sociable to make their own rules and roles  within the peer groups. For instnace my sister does not volunteer for her communitis, however she  enthusiatically worked in peer group study everyday  to prepare her project in school. Then she could get ""A+"" in the project.
 To sum up, I agree that young people spend most time for ouw",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face immense pressure to succeed academically and professionally, which can lead to stress and anxiety. The constant pursuit of achievements and societal expectations can overshadow the simple pleasures of life. Conversely, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to appreciate the finer things in life, such as spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, and traveling.

Secondly, young people may be more susceptible to fleeting trends and social pressures, leading to a constant chase for validation and external approval. This can create a sense of dissatisfaction and a feeling of being constantly on the go. Older individuals, on the other hand, may have developed a stronger sense of self and are less likely to be swayed by external influences. They have learned to appreciate the value of inner peace and contentment.
In conclusion, while youth may offer certain advantages, such as physical vitality and a sense of possibility, it is not a guarantee of happiness. Older individuals have accumulated wisdom, experience, and a deeper understanding of life's complexities, which can contribute to a fulfilling and enjoyable existence. Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that transcends age and is influenced by a multitude of factors.",
"Younger people enjoys life more than the older people do.I will go with this ,although it is said that one should be younger at heart rather than by your age.Another saying says that you should be younger at heart to enjoy the life to the fullest.
Young people are always envied by the olders that they are having more fun.It is  true since younger people has all the time,enthusiasm as well as the energy to enjoy the life till maximum.The younger generation involves themselves into lot of extra-curricular activities.The younger generation have all the time for all the enjoyments.After their studies they do not have  great responsibilities to take care of.Thus they are free to do all the stuff what they want. The younger lot has got all the companions in the form  of friends to enjoy the time they are having.Enjoying or having fun becomes more when you are having a friend.Moreover the younger people are a lot energetic to carry out the adventurous stufs of camping or touring.While youger lot are able to get away with anythiny they do.They are not responsible to any of the action or to say they are not bothered what others have to say.
As the person grows older he is bond into varuious social rituals.  He is now married  and having family.The life of a older person is distributed into various phases like private life ,family life ,professional life etc.Now the man is carrying various family,professional and social responsiblities.After all these things he is left with a very limited time or resources to enjoy the life.Although its much needed to say here that they meaning of enjoyment changes here.
But keeping the fact that younger people enjoys the life more,it should be taken care that they do not run on to the rough patches.The younger lot is very much vulnerable to get spoilt,so its becomes duty of the younger people that they should\ take care of these things and thsy also should be the part of the enjoyment along with the younger generation.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that older individuals lack the capacity for joy and fulfillment. In fact, both age groups have unique experiences and perspectives that contribute to their overall enjoyment of life. 

Young people often experience life with a sense of novelty and excitement. They are exploring new experiences, building relationships, and pursuing their passions. This sense of discovery can lead to a heightened sense of enjoyment. For example, a young person embarking on their first solo trip abroad might feel an overwhelming sense of freedom and exhilaration. However, this excitement can sometimes be fleeting, and the challenges of navigating adulthood can lead to stress and anxiety. 

Older people, on the other hand, have had the opportunity to cultivate wisdom and resilience through years of life experiences. They have learned to appreciate the simple things in life, such as spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, and contributing to their communities. This sense of contentment and purpose can lead to a deep and lasting sense of fulfillment. For instance, a retired teacher who volunteers at a local library might find immense satisfaction in sharing their knowledge and helping others. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not solely determined by age. It is a complex interplay of individual circumstances, personality, and life experiences. While young people may have a more carefree approach to life, older individuals often possess a deeper understanding of what truly matters. Both groups have the potential to experience joy and fulfillment in their own unique ways.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements accurately portray products, many others employ persuasive techniques to make products appear more desirable than they truly are. This essay argues that most advertisements do indeed exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, often resorting to misleading claims and unrealistic portrayals. 

One common tactic used by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often highlight the positive aspects of a product while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals with dramatic transformations, but fail to mention the potential side effects or the need for lifestyle changes. This selective focus creates an illusion of effortless results, enticing consumers to purchase the product without fully understanding its limitations. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. They use evocative imagery, catchy jingles, and celebrity endorsements to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. By associating these positive emotions with the product, advertisers create a sense of desirability and urgency, even if the product itself is not inherently exceptional. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous couple enjoying a romantic getaway, implying that using the perfume will lead to similar experiences. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority employ persuasive techniques to make products seem more appealing than they actually are. By selectively presenting information, using emotional appeals, and creating unrealistic expectations, advertisers often mislead consumers into believing that a product will solve their problems or fulfill their desires. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"I donot agree that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communties. Youth are very enthustiastic about helping other people. I can prove my point with real life examples of me and friends are giving our best effort to improve our communities in all sort of ways. It is a big misconception that youth is inactive in community service today. 	

	First, I have a friend called Ravi. He is a very busy and diligent student. He very normal and contemporary. But, he never allows these reasons to overshadow he ability to perform community service. He went a eye hospital ""AMG"" in Rajavolu in Rajahmundry. This is free hospital for the health needs of the poor and needy. He wanted to give his best effort to support the cause of the hospital eventhough he is very busy. 		

             During holidays for the 9th summer, He became involved in eye screening of the poor school children. After receving the guidance of a establisted opthamologist he went to screen the children for vitamin A deficiency. He made a check list of each symptomes for individual child and reported it to the doctor for more medical care. Next summer he became involved in Glacoma awareness camp. In this camp he counselled patients and explained the importance of medication for the serious disease such as Glacoma. These were few for his many accomplishments. 

	He told his friends including me the joy in giving a ""hand of help"" for our community. His expriences had a huge influence on us. We too became involved in various voluntary services.  I became involved in adult education campaign. Here I taught some illiterate adults basic reading and writing skills. This experience had huge influence on me. I could access how valuble education is when I saw the plight of the illiterate adults. I will never forget this experience.

	Finally, All these experiences show that youth definetly involves in community service. Youth need encouragement and good support from thier family and friends to make this possible. Youth will realise that community service give a kind of self satisfaction that very valuble. In conclusion, young people realise that this society is ours and we have responsibility to serve for our societies.",
"life is a wonderful gift of God. This should be enjoyed till one has its last breath. I feel that it is in the younger age you can enjoy life the most. There are three main  reasons for this.
First factor for enjoyment is health. only healthy person can enjoy his life by indulging in various kinds of activities like going to diffrent places for vacation, thriling activities like bunging jumping, sky gliding and so on. I am sure such activities though enjoyable are not possible for the older people. It is a fruit only to be tasted at younger age.
Second thing is that when a person is young he dosent have to many responsibilities like earning bread and butter for the family or to support some one in the family all he is supposed to do is attending college get good grades and have fun. During this period of ones life one can enjoy the life to the most. Person in old age has responsibility and his priorities to enjoy had changed he rather enjoyes in supporting family.
last but not the least to have fun one requires money. Everyone agrees that during younger age when you are in college or have just completed the college to start a new job earning to expenditure ratio is quite high. One can easily spent on one self to go on vacation and thrilling supports without having much difficulty.
In conclusion I can say that God has given this presious gift to enjoy. Future is very uncertain and unpridictable what ever is there is present. One who cannot live his present happily cannot expect that happiness will come to him at dawn of his life.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I firmly believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic subjects is more beneficial in today's interconnected world. This essay will explore the advantages of a well-rounded education, highlighting its relevance to personal growth, adaptability, and problem-solving skills. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters intellectual curiosity and a deeper understanding of the world. By exploring diverse subjects, individuals gain a holistic perspective, connecting seemingly disparate fields and recognizing patterns across disciplines. For instance, studying history alongside economics provides a nuanced understanding of economic trends and their historical context. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive analysis of complex issues, leading to more informed decisions and a richer understanding of the human experience. 

Furthermore, a broad education equips individuals with greater adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. The job market is increasingly demanding individuals with diverse skillsets and the ability to learn new things quickly. A broad knowledge base provides a solid foundation for acquiring new skills and adapting to evolving demands. For example, a student with a background in both science and humanities may be better equipped to transition into a career in data analysis, combining their analytical skills with their understanding of human behavior. 

Finally, a broad education cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By engaging with diverse perspectives and methodologies, individuals develop the ability to analyze information, synthesize ideas, and generate creative solutions. This is particularly crucial in today's complex world, where problems often require interdisciplinary approaches. For instance, tackling climate change requires expertise in environmental science, economics, and policy, highlighting the need for individuals with a broad understanding of interconnected issues. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more enriching and adaptable educational experience. By fostering intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and critical thinking skills, a well-rounded education prepares individuals for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",
"It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialised in one specific subject . I think  , that  broad knwoledge is good as this can provide with a lot informations ,  a job opportunity and make the person to be well known as discussed in the paragraphs below.
Broad knowledge can provides with a lot of information in various fields .information which will be used as an assets and help the person to be aware of a situations . this awarenes will help the person to know how to solve problem and to deal with any particular situation which may happened .the situation can be worse as for example safety which demand quick thinking ability and action . a person with a broad knwoledge will be helpful to others during the time of distress as well as in time of succes .
In addition to that , this ability of knowing many things will provides with a better chance to be ready for any job opportunity . the more the knowlegde the better the chance of  getting employement . 
Furthermore , people with broad knowledge have a less chance to stay jobless as they can fit in any filed provided that they can do something which help them to sustain their life.
However ,specific knowledge help the person to sustain his life and get a good job but it does not unsure that if the person is given another job if he will fit in .
Therefore , broad knowlegde of many academic subject is very helpful as thet can provide a person whith a good opportunity for job search ans well as wide knowledge in his life which is like an assetsto use if thing get worse without expected .",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, claiming that they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a simplistic and inaccurate view.

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, such as pursuing new experiences and adventures, may not hold the same appeal to an older individual who values stability and contentment. For example, a young person might find immense pleasure in traveling the world, while an older person might prioritize spending time with family and pursuing hobbies.

Secondly, life experiences shape our perspectives and influence our capacity for enjoyment. Older people have accumulated wisdom and resilience through years of challenges and triumphs. They have learned to appreciate the simple things in life and find joy in the quiet moments. They have also developed a deeper understanding of their own values and priorities, allowing them to focus on what truly matters to them.

Finally, the notion that youth is synonymous with enjoyment overlooks the anxieties and pressures that young people face. From academic pressures to social expectations, young people often navigate a complex and demanding world. While they may experience moments of pure joy, their lives are also filled with uncertainty and stress.

In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification. While youth may possess a certain energy and enthusiasm, enjoyment is a multifaceted concept that is influenced by individual preferences, life experiences, and personal circumstances. Both young and old have the potential to find joy and fulfillment in life, each in their own unique way.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain carefree spirit and boundless energy, claiming that they experience more joy is a generalization that overlooks the multifaceted nature of happiness. 

Firstly, older individuals often have a deeper appreciation for life's simple pleasures. Having navigated the complexities of adulthood, they may find contentment in the quiet moments, the company of loved ones, and the satisfaction of achieving long-term goals. For example, a retired teacher might find immense joy in spending time with grandchildren, a passion they couldn't fully indulge in during their working years.

Secondly, older people have accumulated a wealth of experiences that contribute to their well-being. They have witnessed both triumphs and setbacks, learned from mistakes, and developed a resilience that allows them to navigate life's challenges with greater wisdom and perspective. This accumulated knowledge and understanding can lead to a sense of fulfillment and peace that younger individuals may not yet possess.
Finally, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. What brings joy to a teenager might not hold the same appeal to a senior citizen. While young people may prioritize social activities and physical pursuits, older individuals may find satisfaction in intellectual stimulation, creative endeavors, or simply enjoying the peace of their surroundings.
In conclusion, while youth may have a certain vibrancy and energy, it is inaccurate to claim that they enjoy life more than older people.
Happiness is a complex emotion that is influenced by a multitude of factors, and the experiences and perspectives of older individuals contribute significantly to their overall well-being.",
"At certain points of our lives, everyone has to make essential decisions that will have consequences for the rest of our lives. One of this decision is education, the path of studying we want to follow; then the following crucial question will arise: it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject?
  The answer is not so straightforward, it is not possible to rank broad knowledge versus specialization, we have to find a deeper response.
  A broad knowledge is essential because a variety of different situations will show in front of us along all our life and to deal with them, we need a basic knowledge.
  For example, we are not required to know how to make a surgery, but we are better off if we know that if we have the flu, it is better if we stay at home and not stay outside at the cold.
   On the other hand, since it is not possible to have an extensive knowledge on every possible subject, we need to specialize in something to find a job, from the most humble to the most powerful.
  The level of specialization will depend on the job we would like to do or that is offered to us; thinking again about the previous example, if you are a chirurgian, you have to reach a very high level of specializiation, while if you are a waiter you don't need a very sophisticated knowledge.
  Besides, a first broad knowledge is useful to understand which are your preferences and what you would like to do in your life. If you don' t learn the first basic concepts or notions of astronomy, you will never know if you prefer this subject than studying chemistry.
  At the end, the bottom line is that a broad knowledge is essential for everyday life and this broad knowledge doesn' t need to be too sophisticated, but if you want to make career or if you have certain aspirations, surely you will need to specialize in something.",
"Some people prefer to to have alot of knowlege and they don't like to focus on one subject but others like to focus on one subject and try to know every thing in that subject by specializing in it. I think it's better to specialize in one specific subject rather that having knowledge of many subjects because it's better for the society, it makes you more focused, and makes you more successful.
     First of all, specializing in one subject is better for the society because you will be professional in the feild you work in and therfore you will carry your role in the community in the best way possible. Also, people will depend on you in everything that is releated to the subject you are specialized in. For example, if you are a doctor that is specialized in heart disease every one will depend on you to help them with their heart problems and you will be helpful to your community.
     Second of all, if you are specialized in one subject you will have all the time to focus on that subject and it will be easier to concentrate. Having only one subject you will have the time to know more about that subject and learn extra information which will be useful to your subject. Also, when you are studying you won't be frusturated and lost between many subjects because you will have to focus on that subject.
     Finally, it's obvious that if you concentrate more on the same subject you will be more successful in your studies which will lead to a successful career. Knowing more about your subject by specializing in it will make you a professional worker and therfore more successful.
     In conculsion, specializing in one subject is far more better that having general knowledge in many subjects because of the reasons I explained above and many more reasons. Having general knowledge is not as useful as specializing in a certian subject especially if the subject you specialize in is an important subject.",
"As people get older, they realize what was obvious from the beginning: that they will die. Eventhough this may sound sad, it still is the truth that we all share. By realizing and accepting this unchangeble fact, people start to enjoy life more than they did in their young years. So I must say that I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more that older people do.
	Being young is like being god. You feel that you are capable of doing anything and everything. This misleading idea push young people to their limits. They spend their time trying new thinks, without any kind of commitment,  until they are done with the excitement, which they felt due to the fact that they are trying something new. In this sense we even can say that young people are like scouts, they just cant sit still and enjoy something. They always feel the urge to go forward and explore the horizon. On the other hand; older people are in peace with the fact that their time in this world is shorter than the rest and they cant do everything with the time that left to them, so they try to settle down and enjoy things that they encountered throughout their lives. Thats why we can see older people everywhere who is doing something which can be seen as boring for younger people. For example sailing or painting. 
	Another important fact why older people do enjoy life more than young people is that they accompished what young people cant taste. Older people had spent more time on this earth that younger people so we can say that they had their own share of succes; they formed families and most probably maintain the survival of their genes. This gives older people a feeling of victory over life so they can spent their time celebrating it. Just feeling like a long war is over and peace is ettablished: a peace with themselves.
	To summarize we can say that old people enjoy life more than young people because they spent enough time to overcome their urges. They had enough experience to realize what they really want and they go for it. Moreover; they  realize that their time is limites so they want to make the best of it. All these, help old people to enjoy life more that young people do.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image, often exaggerating or even fabricating qualities to entice consumers. This essay argues that most advertisements do indeed make products seem much better than they really are, employing a range of techniques to achieve this goal. 

One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They focus on highlighting the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals achieving dramatic transformations, but fail to mention the possible side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise. This selective portrayal creates an unrealistic expectation that the product will deliver miraculous results, which is rarely the case in reality. 

Furthermore, advertisements often employ persuasive language and imagery to evoke emotional responses in viewers. They use catchy slogans, vibrant colors, and appealing visuals to create a sense of excitement, desire, and even necessity for the product. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous model in a luxurious setting, suggesting that using the product will make the consumer feel sophisticated and desirable. This emotional appeal can overshadow the actual functionality or quality of the product, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based on superficial factors. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority strive to present products in a more favorable light than they deserve. By selectively presenting information, employing persuasive language, and appealing to emotions, advertisers create an idealized image that often fails to reflect the true nature of the product. Consumers must be aware of these tactics and exercise critical thinking when evaluating advertisements to avoid falling prey to unrealistic expectations and potentially disappointing purchases.",
"Enjoyment means make the life happy.by satisfying the soul of the body not only physically but also mentally.if a person can get through both the mental and physical stresses.Then the person is said to be enjoying his life.For the enjoyment of the life especially the is no age limit.both young ang old people can enjoy the life beautifully if they plan there life properly.if not the person at any age can not enjoy his life.
In my opinon old people enjoy there life more happyily than the Younger ones because,in this morden world people should run with the time they rearly get the time to enjoy.
For instance if u see a school going boy/girl they alway run with the time. there curriculam schedule is so tight that they are unable even to talk to there own parents.they are totally missing there sweet time by enjoying with there parent which is necessary for a young child to share his feelings,which is not possible for a young child.but the older people are spending enjoyable life by doing the things at the time they want to do atleast they are having that liberty.
coming to the young people who are going to jobs they schedule is also not at all planned according to them.they hav to do hard work to earn money.The people around him will respect him only if he have money.So people all over the world is runnig all around to earn money.Such young people who are at great stress full job are unable even to take care of there health.so they are also not enjoying the life.If we see odler people who are out of there jobs are atleast having right food at time.they are enjoying by taking care of there own grand children.
Thus,i conclude that even youngstrers can enjoy there life if they make some free time sharing there happiness and sadness with there family or friends.They can really enjoy the full sweetness of life than older ones.because they have great time to enjoy.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, I believe that both young and old can find profound joy in life, albeit in different ways.
Young people often have the advantage of physical vitality and a sense of limitless possibilities. They are less burdened by responsibilities and can explore new experiences with a sense of adventure. For example, a young person might find immense joy in traveling the world, pursuing a new hobby, or simply spending time with friends. However, this carefree spirit can also be fleeting and may be overshadowed by anxieties about the future, pressure to succeed, and the constant need for validation.
Older people, on the other hand, may have a more nuanced understanding of life's complexities. They have accumulated wisdom through years of experience, learned to appreciate the simple things, and developed deeper relationships. The joy they find may stem from the satisfaction of achieving their goals, witnessing the growth of their families, or simply enjoying the peace and quiet of their later years. For instance, a retired teacher might find immense joy in mentoring young students or volunteering in their community.
Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that is influenced by a multitude of factors, including age, personality, and life circumstances. While young people may have a more carefree approach to life, older people can find profound joy in the wisdom and contentment that comes with age. Both stages of life offer unique opportunities for happiness, and it is a mistake to assume that one is inherently more enjoyable than the other.",

Firstly, young people often have fewer responsibilities and commitments, allowing them to explore new experiences and pursue their passions with greater freedom. They may be less burdened by financial worries or family obligations, enabling them to travel, experiment with different hobbies, and focus on personal growth. For instance, a recent graduate may have the opportunity to travel the world, something that might be more difficult for someone with a family and a mortgage. 

However, older people often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and have developed a greater appreciation for the simple things.

"It is a difficult question, but for me, the choice is clear. I disagree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.	There are two reasons; the prevention of the reallity and the conclution of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers.
	The first reason is the prevention of the reallity. It is based on the situation that customers ordinally make a judge from the advertisement whether they buy it or not.  I think advertisements should be besed on the products. The role of the advertisements is telling customer what the products rally are and what points are distinguish on other products. The advertisements should be neesded the reallity of the products. The second reason is the construction of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers. The advertisement explains about the product, so the custmer can buy it without anxious. 
	Those are my opinions.  Thus, I disagree the following statement.",
"Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. This is undoubtedly true and i would absolutely agree with it. Today's generation have become more hardworking and sincere towards their carrer. There is so much of competition that the young generation is just so busy preparing themselves for a better and more secure future . There is so much of competition that one does not have the time and energy left to support their communities. They find it very demanding to support  their very own survival that they feel it will hamper their future if they invest time in supporting their communities.
One example i would like to mention here is that a friend of mine who use to be always busy supporting his community found that people started exploiting him and taking undue advatage of his goodness and kindness. He felt that he was putting his future at stake if he would carry on helping his community and he was not even sure that if tomorrow he would be in a problem whether somebody would be there in times when he would be in crisis.
Infact one day while he was helping a member of his community, that member said this line ""God helps those who help themselves"". He told him son start helping yourself first by doing well in your academics and then help your community. That day he realised how far his friends had gone in life and how much of effort he will have to make to shape a good future for himself now. 
One really doesn't know what life lie's ahead of him or her and to secure their future they concentrate on their work. That is why young people of today's generation do not give enough time to helping their communities.",
"I think that this is a generalization of the young word, and so I think that it is not a true statement.
Might be true the fact that a part of young people does not help the other person who need their help, or does not put their ability or competences for a `better word`, or simply a` better local community`, but is also true that there are so many guys that every day make their `good action`, or work hard for a right ideal to find a sense in their life.
For example there are so many boys and girls that dedicate their free time to helping poor people, or to visit sick people, or simply help an old woman to cross the street. Is not that also an act of civil sense?
On the other hand I think that pheraps nowadays it is difficult to help the community, because the community makes see and think you what she wants.
To explain, if a young boy does not respect some civic rules, or he does not care the others, it is just because the community does not teachs him to give importance to this important aspect, because the community makes see a winner model that is not a good model of person.
But  the young person have more than sometimes the necessary strenght to go on, indipendently by wrong schemes, to track his ideal of life, that are really good ideal of life.
I think that it is the point: a young person is more encoureged to change the society by his inexperiece, but at the end is society that changes him, and corrupts him making of him an adult person.
In fact this is the main passage from the young age
So my opinion is simply that the society might change to help young to change her.",
"In the realm of education, a perennial debate rages on: is it more beneficial to acquire a broad knowledge base across various academic subjects or to delve deeply into a single specialization? While specialization undoubtedly offers profound expertise, I firmly believe that a broad education is more advantageous in today's dynamic world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters intellectual flexibility and adaptability. In a rapidly evolving society, individuals with diverse knowledge are better equipped to navigate unfamiliar situations and tackle complex problems. For instance, a historian with a grasp of economics can analyze the impact of historical events on economic trends, while a scientist with an understanding of literature can communicate their research findings effectively. This interdisciplinary approach allows individuals to see connections and draw insights that might be missed by specialists.
Secondly, a broad education cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By exploring different perspectives and disciplines, students develop the ability to analyze information, evaluate arguments, and formulate solutions from multiple angles. This holistic approach is crucial in today's interconnected world, where issues often require interdisciplinary solutions. For example, addressing climate change necessitates collaboration between scientists, economists, and policymakers.
Finally, a broad education fosters well-rounded individuals with a deeper understanding of the world. By engaging with diverse subjects, students gain a broader perspective on human history, culture, and society. This exposure to different ideas and viewpoints promotes empathy, tolerance, and a more informed citizenry.

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad education offers a more valuable foundation for success in today's complex world. It fosters intellectual flexibility, critical thinking, and a deeper understanding of the world, making individuals better equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",
"Some people may think that people should specialize in one specific subject because they can write a good thesis. However,  I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons.

First of all, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is useful for working. For example, in 2000, when I was a forth year student in University of Tokyo, my major was civil engineering. Of course, I took the subjects about the civil engineering, but I also tool the subjects such as economics and politics. Now, I work at Japan Central railway company as a engineer and my project is to plan to build the station building. I need to discuss with many co-workers. I can solve the problems about this project effectively because I learn about wide knowledge about many subjects. As a result, this project goes on very well. This experience shows that having wide knowledge of a lot of academic subjects is very useful for working.

In addition, people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about many academic subjects. For instance, I join on the swimming club now. This team is consist of a lot of members such as professors in Keio University, workers at banks and engineers at heavy industrial companies. In this club, we often go to the bar after the practice of the swimming and exchange some information. I can communicate effectively with every members because I have wide knowledge of many academic subjects and I can ask some questions to them. As a result, I can make many friends.As the above example demonstrates, people can communicate well  by having wide knowledge about a lot of academic subjects. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",
"The ubiquitous nature of advertising in our modern world has led to a common belief that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products. While it is true that some advertisements employ deceptive tactics, I disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 

Firstly, many advertisements focus on highlighting the unique features and benefits of a product, rather than outright fabricating them. For example, a car commercial might emphasize the fuel efficiency of a particular model, which is a genuine attribute. While the advertisement might not explicitly mention the car's potential drawbacks, it is not necessarily misleading viewers.

Secondly, consumers are increasingly discerning and aware of advertising techniques. With access to vast amounts of information online, consumers can easily research products and compare different brands. This allows them to make informed decisions based on their own needs and preferences, rather than solely relying on advertising claims.

Finally, regulations and consumer protection laws exist to prevent outright deception in advertising. Advertisers are held accountable for making false or misleading claims, and consumers have recourse if they feel they have been misled. This helps to ensure that advertisements are generally truthful and accurate.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may employ hyperbole or selective presentation of information, it is inaccurate to claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Consumers are increasingly informed and have access to tools that allow them to verify claims and make informed decisions. The existence of regulations further safeguards against deceptive practices, promoting a more transparent and ethical advertising landscape.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether it is more beneficial to have a broad understanding of many subjects or to specialize in one specific area has been a subject of ongoing debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more valuable in today's interconnected world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters intellectual flexibility and adaptability. In an era of rapid technological advancements and evolving industries, individuals with diverse knowledge are better equipped to navigate new challenges and seize emerging opportunities. For example, a person with a background in both computer science and business might be able to seamlessly transition into the field of data analytics, combining their technical skills with their understanding of market trends. 

Secondly, a broad education cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By encountering different perspectives and disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze complex issues from multiple angles and synthesize information from various sources. This holistic approach to learning enhances creativity and innovation, enabling individuals to find novel solutions to problems that transcend disciplinary boundaries. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base promotes effective communication and collaboration. Individuals who are well-versed in different subjects can better understand and appreciate the perspectives of others, fostering meaningful dialogue and collaboration. This is particularly important in today's globalized society, where interdisciplinary teamwork is essential for addressing complex challenges such as climate change and global health. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more comprehensive and adaptable approach to learning. It fosters intellectual flexibility, critical thinking, and effective communication, equipping individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing world.",
"A person starts to learn from birth to death. The amount of knowledge changes over time during this life perod. Its contents become more spesific and detailed as well. A baby can say limited words until he learn his mother language. Therefore, specializing in one subject  is in the nature of the human being, so it should be prior to having broad knowledge in a person's life.
	The school contents are being specialized as the person grows. For instance, in primary school, there is no majors. On the other hand, in high schools or universities, the person chooses his department according to his area of interest. Moreover, comparing the bachelor degree, master degree is more spesific on one subject. Therefore, specialization is an unevitiable process that we face during our early period of our lives namely the education period.
	However, after this specialization period of the life, general information becomes more valuable to the person. For instance, a computer engineer works in the programming department of a company until the age of 35, As a result of the idealistic instinct of human being, he wants to get higher degree in the department. However, an executive master degree in business administration is required for such a position. Therefore, the person gets the degree to reach his goal.  When the value of specific knowledge decreases, having broad knowledge becomes more valuable. 
	 The life periods of specialization and having broad knowledge is in an order which affects the attitudes of human towards the types of knowledge. Since I am a student now, it is better to speacialize in one spesific subject, however; when I become in my thirties, I will probably to get my knowledge broader.",
Im strongly disagree with the statement as i iknow old pepople and young people the can enjoy in deferent way according to their age and their ability .There are many things old people can enjoy doing for example going to cinemas or going to park with families .I THINK some old people they did not agree to go out or they are unable to do so but if we are encourange them to do that  they will.in addition the children should treat there parents in a polite way so that they can enjoy their remaining life even though they are old that is not an excuise to deal with them in a bad way or to keep them away from comunity . furthermore some people may not be very good with there parents thats why the old people may refuse to enteract with others and the prefere to be aione rether than going out and enjoy thersself  In some country the goverment provid a special places for the old people to leave especialy for those who do not have the place to leave and it may contain alots of functions that created for them to take off there worried and boring that is a good thing  and also there is a special places that builed and designed for the old and disabbled people to move easily .                                                                  in conclusion i think every one right to enjoy there lifes and its not setele,
"Young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people. 
Age factor is one the main reasons that put life of older people whithin limits. 
    First of all, most sports require an age limit, such as Tennis and Foot-Ball. As an Example, my father loves Foot-Ball but he can no longer play it, because he cannot run as fast as he used to. Another example is Mountain Climbing. Most mountain climbers are young because this kind of activity require good heart rates and endurance, and as we all know, the older a person gets, the less his heart operates due to age factor. Second, older people have less sex drive than they had before. Also, old women can no longer have babies after 45th year of their age. Young people can perform lot of sports activities. Most sports players are less than 25 years old as required by most sports.
  As a result, unlike older people who are usually on diet or on medical treatments that prevents them from eating or drinking what they like, most younger people do not fall under those restrictions that prevents a person from doing what he or she likes to do.",

In peculiar,when you have the children ,you have a new situation and new life.All your past became souvenirs.

"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local clean-up drives to advocating for environmental sustainability, young people are taking the lead in addressing pressing issues. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, showcases their commitment to creating positive change. These individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices to raise awareness and inspire others to act.
Furthermore, many young people dedicate their time to supporting vulnerable populations. Volunteering at soup kitchens, mentoring underprivileged children, or participating in fundraising events for charitable causes are just a few examples of their dedication. These acts of kindness demonstrate a deep understanding of social responsibility and a desire to make a difference in the lives of others.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From leading social movements to providing direct support to those in need, young people are actively shaping a better future. Their commitment to service, though often overlooked, is a testament to their compassion and desire to make a positive impact on the world.",
"The Fake	
	The world is globlazing every day and this make people to aware of everything that happen in casual. It is because of the communication through the television.
	Firstly the television has a great place in people`s life. When we come home from work, school or outside it is always in front of us and it affects us very deeply. By the television some advertisements can be seen. When something new was descovered that includes food drink or clothes its advertismenyts are always on the television and that makes people consider about buying that. It is clearly understood that  people are more interested in the products that they see on the television. If the advertisement producers make the advertisement very successfully people starts to admire to those products. For instances When my family goes to shopping, they buy familiar things and those that they see on the television screen. I am definitely agree statement about the advertisements that product seem much better than they really are. Even if the materials are poor for use the advertisements convince people to buy it and show them charming. For example last year there was an advertisement about shampoo. It was unknown and the its first year of the company. When i saw the shampoo on the television i really intented to buy it because it seems not only attractive but also popular beacuse it is known by everybody. Unfortunately when i used it many times i concluded that it is only seen better in shape not in use. After that i shared that event with my friends and almost all of that agreed to me and now all of us are careful while shopping. 
	All in all, as i explained that above, i agree the following statement. People normally cares the visuality but when they use it they understand their fault. To my mind people should be think two times when they buy something and they should not belive in attracted advertisements.",
"I agrees with the statement that the young people recently do not spend enough time on helping their societies. Because of that fact, many older adults complaint about the lack of vounteering activities of young generation into the society. However, young people have several crucial reasons for that. I can point out two main reasons for this situation : absolute lack of time given to young people for helping communities and enhanced status of communities compared to the previous. 
  First, there is no enough time given to young people for helping the communities because of doing other important things. These days, the competition for the job and money between young people are getting more severe and complicated. As the certain preferred jobs among young people are limited and many young people want to achieve it, they really need to satisfy various requirements requested by the company. For example, as the society is getting enlarged to the global world, the fluency in other languages are critical. This makes young people to go abroad for certain periods to study other languages and broaden their view. However, this usually costs a lot for the young people to afford which makes them to work many hours concurrently in their youth. Other general requirement for young people from the company is to have a experience of internships in a big company prior to enter their company. So, they need to prepare for the applications and interviews for that. All these requirements forces young people to work on many things during their youth. Therefore, in order to successively achieve their goals, they will not have enough time to volunteer for the community.  
 Second, the status of the communities become much better and enhanced compared to the previous period which all the citizens needed to participate on developing communities. If our communities has been struggling in to the severe problems such as the long-lasting drought, wide spread of contagious diseases among people, or extreme overpopulation of abandoned elders and orphans, young people would be willing to participate to make the cummunity better. However, the current cummunities does not seem to require all young people to participate in making a better community. It looks like it can be achieved through the help of young people who have enough time and older people who can be actively involved in communities based on their matured and various experiences.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them seem far superior to their actual capabilities. 

One compelling reason for this exaggeration is the inherent nature of advertising itself. The primary goal of an advertisement is to persuade consumers to buy a product. To achieve this, advertisers often employ various techniques, such as using catchy slogans, appealing visuals, and celebrity endorsements, to create a positive and desirable image of the product. This often involves highlighting the product's strengths while downplaying or completely omitting its weaknesses. For instance, a car advertisement might showcase the vehicle's sleek design and powerful engine, while conveniently neglecting to mention its poor fuel efficiency or limited cargo space. 

Furthermore, the use of selective information and misleading claims is prevalent in many advertisements. Advertisers may cherry-pick data to support their claims, or they may use ambiguous language that can be interpreted in multiple ways. For example, a beauty product advertisement might claim to reduce wrinkles, but the fine print may reveal that the results are based on a small sample size or a short-term study. Such tactics can mislead consumers into believing that the product is more effective than it truly is. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may present a relatively accurate picture of products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits and qualities. The inherent nature of advertising, coupled with the use of selective information and misleading claims, contributes to this phenomenon. Consumers should be aware of these tactics and exercise caution when evaluating product claims made in advertisements.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a complex one. While specialization offers in-depth understanding and expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When exposed to diverse subjects, individuals develop the ability to connect ideas, analyze information from multiple perspectives, and find creative solutions. For example, a historian studying the French Revolution might gain valuable insights from understanding economic principles or social psychology. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. 

Secondly, broad knowledge promotes adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's interconnected society, individuals are constantly encountering new challenges and opportunities. A well-rounded education equips them with the flexibility to navigate these changes and adapt to new situations. For instance, a person with a broad understanding of technology, business, and communication might be better prepared to transition into a new career field or adapt to technological advancements. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. When individuals are exposed to a wide range of subjects, they are more likely to develop a passion for exploring new ideas and expanding their horizons. This intrinsic motivation to learn is essential for personal growth and intellectual fulfillment. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in the long run. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a lifelong love of learning, ultimately enriching individuals and contributing to a more informed and engaged society.",
"With the development of society,there are increasing choices  to enjoy life as people can play computer games ,chat on line ,or go to see a live performance etc.Although these all seem to be what only young people can do as they accept new inventions and opinions more quickly and have more energy to enjoy,it is a little bit haste to assert that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
    Does young people really have more time and energy to enjoy life?As the pace of modern society fastens,young people who have already had a job face the pressure from their bosses,family members and other people,worrying about not getting promoted without recommendation,being troubled by a tiny mistake during the work and therefore making great efforts to work in the hope of  completing  their tasks perfectly.As a result,they always keep in a hurry to get things done and seldom have energy to enjoy their life.What's more, for the young people who are still college students,the fierce competion when hunting a  job also drives them to study hard and develop many kinds of skills.For example,in the college I am studying in,most of students are striving to get certificates in business English and computer skills and taking a lot of courses such as communication skills ,which may be helpful in future career.In contrast,as older people don't have to face  all the challenges ,risks and difficult choices ,they tend to have a more peaceful mind and enjoy life more than young people.
     Some people also argue that the modern technology such as computer skills used in many methods to relax  makes it hard for older people to enjoy.In fact,many old people have been accustomed to taking adavantage of these innovations.For example,my grandfather who is 60 years old have been good at chatting on line and downloading movies and music from Internet just like a young person.And also ,old people can enjoy life in  different ways without technology.They can take a walk and take exercises in a park,or listen to music sitting in a chair ,and for some of them ,looking at grandchildren being around is a kind of relaxation.",
"The statement that the,  "" Young people enjoy life more than the older people do"",  appears very vague to me. It is a very generalized statement. In my opinion age is just a number and it is the attidude towards life is that matters the most. I believe, if we have a positive attitude then no matter what our age is we will be optimistic and have a zest for life and for other social- cultural activities. In fact as we grow old, we mature and start making wise decisions instead of being impulsive. 

Young people in my personal opinion are hyperactive and prudent. When young we just want to do things which will give us short term happiness or pleasures. During the growing up years, the tendency is to enjoy and to experience everything without considering the ramifications of their actions. But when we compare, the enjoyment that comprises of physical activities, like sports or other adventurous outdoor activities( like biking, hiking, surfing etc.) then there is no denial that the young people enjoy and make the most of it! 

Also when we are young, we face the hardships of life, education, job which at times can leave a little time for adventure or enjoyment. But as we grow old, by that time, we have taken care of our responsibilities, achieved and accomplished our goals. Then we adopt a  more relaxed attitude to enjoy the benefits of our hardwork. So in a way it can be a debatable question who enjoys the life more, the young or the old! 

As far as I am concerned, I do not agree that only young people enjoy life more. Enjoyment and happiness are also associated with    the way we humans percieve things. So enjoyment of life by younger generation can also be dubbed as an ambiguous entity.",
"The statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess certain advantages, such as boundless energy and a sense of possibility, it is inaccurate to claim that they inherently enjoy life more than their elders.


Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, like pursuing new experiences or chasing dreams, may not hold the same appeal for an older individual who values stability and contentment. For instance, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive more pleasure from spending time with their family and nurturing their hobbies. 

Secondly, older people often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and have learned to appreciate the simple things. They have experienced both joy and sorrow, triumphs and failures, and have gained wisdom from their journey. This wisdom allows them to find joy in the present moment, even amidst challenges. For example, an older person who has overcome adversity may find solace in the quiet moments of reflection, while a young person might be consumed by anxieties about the future. 

Finally, the enjoyment of life is not solely determined by age but also by individual circumstances and personality. Some young people may be burdened by financial struggles, relationship problems, or mental health issues, while some older people may be thriving in their careers, enjoying good health, and surrounded by loved ones.


In conclusion, while youth may offer certain advantages, it is unfair to claim that young people inherently enjoy life more than older people. The enjoyment of life is a complex and multifaceted experience that is influenced by a multitude of factors, including individual circumstances, personality, and life experiences. It is essential to recognize the unique joys and challenges that come with each stage of life and appreciate the diverse perspectives that age brings.",
"There is a phrase that says : Getting old begins when regrets replace dreams.

	On one hand, it is true that young people are more able to enjoy their life than older ones. 

When you have almost your entire life before you and you can make a lot of plans for your future.
The youngest people do not already have to many reponsabilities like children or work and they have more time to enjoy their own life. For example, I want to go and study in Australia for the next semester and I am sure I am going to enjoy me stay and maybe me life there. In our days, there is a lot of ways to entertain. Young people can enjoy it because they are still physically able to do so.
Indeed, young people can do more sports, walk on the mountains, surf, parties etc. That is a way not to find their life too boring. 

	On another hand, I think that being old is a beautiful thing because they can see their childlren growing up, help, advise and support them as much as they can. And they also can enjoy visits from their grandchildren which is certainly a bit magic for anybody.
A lot of old people do travel a lot once retired and really like it. It is much easier to make trips, see new people, make even short-term plans for your life. I know a friend of my grandmother who is travelling all the time over the world and I think she enjoys her life a lot in discovering all these countries. I will spend a lot of time to the same. But when people are working during 30, 40 years or more, they cannot travel this much and enjoy the possibility of traveling by plane wherever you want.

	Finally, I think that older people can enjoy their life as much as young people. We all aim to find happyness in our own way and the question is : How to find it? Who with? There are as many awsers as there are individuals.",
"Nowadays, we can see lots of advertisements in any where, in the train, bus or on the television and any time when we walk on a street  or read newspaper.  Most of advertisements are attractive and wonderful; howvere, I believe that they make products too better than producuts or goods really are because they always point out only profits of goods, never say disadvantage.  

When I see advertisements,  I concentrate on their ""beautiful pictures"" that I am often confused whether they are ture or not.  I think the picture in the advertisement show products' look too good that it appeares clear color, clean, and sometimes it change products' size; therefore I often decive by the picture.  Even though recent technology of camera or photo is increasing, the advertisement should make the products naturally.    

I wonder that the comments of the advertisement is too parfect even though everyone knows that it is for proceding to sell because I have seen only great comments or explantions.  I know that it is important to write or say advantages, but hope that it is helpful if I can",
"Advertisors never tell the truth and nothing but te truth!! I know that advertisors have to make the product seem as good as they could. Thus, it's obvious that they make products seem much better than they really are.
       Let's think about the task that advertising was created to accomplish. It should make us , by convincing or persuading,  buy a certain stuff or service. To do that, advertisors must use any gate to penetrate into our mind, inspite of the credibility of the presented informations. Thus they mention just the adventages of the product, and hide any inconvenients. 
      Once i was really impressed by a perfum advertising, and i buyed it. According to the add it's a long lasting seducer. Nonetheless, according to my experience it""s not lasting. Furthere more it can be the easiest way to loose a women in ten days.(Sorry ""How to loose a women in ten days producers"").
      Some advertisments couldn't be believed at all. I mean those which show things which are not sensible, nor scientifically
 accepted.  In fact there's an advertisement on TV which shows what they called a leather spray. Believe it or not, this spray-according to
 them- is able to cover any surface of damaged leather leather with the same material. All that in spite of the color and the texture of the leather.
      One point that i would like to mention is that advertisors are like lawyers. You shouldn't be innocent just have a good atterney. This rule works in the advertising world. The product doesn't need to be perfect, an efficient advertise would push you to buy it for the  first one. On the other hand you will not keep buying it if it doesn't satisfy your needs.
      In a large spectrum of add, truth is the last thing to care about. Most of the product appear on the net or the TV screen much better than they could be in our kitchens or our garages.",
"Many people have a different idea on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize on one specific subject. People who support the idea insist that having broad knowledge of academic subjects is more useful their future life. However I storngly dissagree the idea for two reasons. First, speciallizing in one specific subject can recieve a good grade during the school time.  Second it can procure a professional job.
 	First of all, speciallizing in one specific subject can recieve a good grade during the school time. That is because it make students to focus on  one specific subject. For example, when I was a unversity student, although I could choice double major in my university, but I didn't choice another subject, because my friend who chosen another subject by double major could not receive good grade. If I choose another major, I would obtain bad grade.
	On top of that specializing in one specific subject can obtain better job. Specializing in one specific subject means being a professional. In addition being a professional can get a high paying job. Let me take my experience. My major is an agricultural engineering. I need to specialize one specific subject that it is a engineering. When I was senior student, other students who were my classmates prepare Englilh in order to applicate company, but I didn't I just specializing",

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a complex one. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. This is because it fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas from different disciplines, fostering critical thinking. For instance, a student with knowledge of both history and economics can analyze historical events through an economic lens, gaining a deeper understanding of their causes and consequences. This interdisciplinary approach encourages critical thinking and the ability to see beyond the confines of a single subject. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base promotes adaptability in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals with diverse skills and the ability to learn new things quickly. A person with a broad education is better equipped to adapt to new challenges and opportunities, as they have a foundation in various fields. For example, a graduate with a degree in literature may find themselves working in marketing, utilizing their strong communication and analytical skills. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters a more holistic understanding of the world. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain a broader perspective on complex issues and can better appreciate the interconnectedness of various fields. This holistic understanding is crucial for making informed decisions and contributing meaningfully to society. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It cultivates critical thinking, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world, preparing individuals for success in a complex and ever-changing environment.",
"Everyday we are forced to see all kinds of advertisements, from television, from radio and even from our post letters. It gives us millions of information, and definately we are influenced by the advertisements more or less. However, I have to say that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are.
   From advertisement, people always see the good looking of the products. For example, the advertisement of the famous brand shampoo,let's just call it P. We can see the beautiful long hair of many ladies, shining and falling, it is easier for people believe that if we use the same product, we will have the same kind of hair. As a result, most of us can not have the same beautiful hair as the model.
    Advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are, another reason is that the advertisements only show the good points of the products, they never let you know the bad side of it. For example, there is a advertisement about a vacume cleaner, in the advertisement, you are told that it is powerful, easy to handle, and you are even showed that how clean the room is after it is used, however, after you buy it at home, after you actually try it, you may find that it is too big to handle, and it takes a large space to store. I have a similar experience last winter. After the first month of the winter season, I was unhappy to find the the gas charge was extramely higher than I expected, I noticed from the televison advertisement that there was some kind of heater seemd very good, it was powerful, good looking, and I went to the store and bought it at once. After one days of use, I had to return it to the store because it made a lot of noises. I was not told about the noise peoblem from the advertisements.
    Most advertisements definately make peoducts seem much better than they really are. That is the use of the advertisements. So better check carefully before you purchase something.",
"Yes, I completely agree with this statement. And, this is the whole idea behind getting the product advertise to lure the consumers and compete in the market. 
	In today's competetive world everything is all about presentation, especially if you want to sell your product in the open market. You really have to prove and show to the people that your product is better than others. Advertising helps seller  in marketing the product and in the process sometimes it  shows the  products  better than they really are. In the age of cut throat competition, advertisment companies tries to show  the best of the best things about the product which is sometimes incorrrect. I have a real life example  to further support my thoughts - I was watching a coca cola advertisment some time back where it was showing that a person  drinking the soft drink saw a girl drowning in the deep ocean. He jumped into the  ocean to save that girl and later on they highlited  that the person is so brave and courageous becaue he drinks coca cola. Ofcourse, this is nowhere near to reality but still good enough to generate interest in the soft drink. Every year million and millions of dollars are spent to get a thirty second slot in the Super Bowl game in United states. 
	There is no harm in showing your product as a perfect one but at the same time one should not make it look like totally different than what thay are.  For instance, in US we get fliers everyday in our mail box about various deals but  you reach the store only to find out that the deal is gone or that commodity is out of stock. But, the advertisment accomplished what was intended there most of the time - generating traffic for the store.

Most of the advertising companies  promotes themselves by saying that they can change the look and feel of the product. They know the tricks to charm the consumer and in the process they make product seem much better than what they really are which is unethical but unfortunately true.",
"This is a problematic issue we are going to speak about.
It is not easy to steadly take a position regarding this statement:
I can just provide my personal experience on this matter:
it's true that I don't use to spend time in helping my community but first we need to make clear what we mean with ""helping mine community"". I'm not into any social organization or no profit company and in this way I'm not helping my community, that's true. But simply because I have not time to do that since I made a choice: I am a student and I chose to give the priority to my studies in order to get a serious job, which obviously, if well done, will bring help to my family, my city and hopefully my nation, or better My Own Community.
Probably you'r gonna ask me which kind of job I'm looking for, what background I have and what studies I'm taking to have such a weird idea about ""helping your community""...well I'm a normal student and I'm going to graduate in engineering, and that is quite common! Also the job I will find will seem normal, but not the way I'll work.
I am sure that if everybody work with interest and good purposes they do help their community, instead of working not motivated and not well prepared. Infact working not well prepared of course is negative first for you, and for your entire community as well.
So, my job right now is to study, and I have no time for being a volunteer helping my community in the ""standard"" ways. I think that the best I can do in order to help my community is to keep studying hard, find a good job and work hard and in a positive way, and of course my job will bring benefits to my community.
This what I mean for ""Helping our Community"".",
"I disagree with the above statement for, simply put, it means ""Jack of all trades and master of none"". I certainly have no idea who came up with this particular phrase but I do percieve it to be very true and apt. A ""broad knowledge"" to my understanding may be defined as enough facts to project a scholarly image in refined society. In other words, claiming to have a read a book by reading its' back cover. Limited knowledge of multiple topics is of no real use unless a person's vocation requires him to possess such knowledge. 
Specialization on the other hand is what leads to pure genius. Certainly some men are born a true genius. But others can get there through hard and consistent work in their particular field meaning specialization. To support my idea I put forward four exemplaries, Indian nuclear scientists - Dr. Homi Bhaba, Vikram Sarabhai, Raja Ramanna, Dr. Abdul Kalam. These men shaped Indian nuclear history. They absorbed nuclear science into their very blood and brought about a revolution in the nuclear field. India owes its present day nuclear status to these men who laid the foundation stone for the edifice of Indian Nucleardom. What would be our status today if these men settled for a broad outlook on general knowledge ?
But this is not to indicate that specialization makes every person reach the heights that these four have achieved. But certainly an in-depth knowledge of any subject leaves the individual with a personal sense of satisfaction for actually having achieved a milestone and also brings him a respectful position in society where his achievement is appreciated by both his friends and others. If we, for example take a heart specialist or a engineer constructing houses, they cannot hope to execute their respective tasks without specialization in their fields. They touch the live of all the people they serve and in addition to their remuneration, they also earn the lasting gratitude of the people for a service well-rendered.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks of products, creating an idealized image that often fails to match reality. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential downsides. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might showcase its sleek design and impressive camera capabilities, but it might fail to mention its limited battery life or the high price tag. This selective presentation creates a distorted perception of the product, leading consumers to believe it is superior to its competitors. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and persuasive language to manipulate consumers' desires. They use catchy slogans, celebrity endorsements, and evocative imagery to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or even envy. By tapping into these emotions, advertisers can create a sense of urgency and convince consumers that they need a particular product to achieve a certain lifestyle or fulfill a specific need. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the actual functionality and value of the product. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often present a distorted and overly optimistic view of products. By selectively highlighting positive aspects, using emotional appeals, and employing persuasive language, advertisers create an idealized image that rarely reflects the true nature of the product. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"Nowadays young people are more concerned about their ownself than helping their community.Everyone is becoming selfish and mean.They see only their benefit and not the others.For them,social life is important till the time it gives them enjoyment and self satisfaction.After the satisfaction is over they turn to some other place where they have reason to go.
When young people don't find any reason that gives them some benefit,they will not turn to that side also where others want some help.
I have realised this from my personal experience.Once I thought to teach some students from my colony.Specifically those who are staying in our neighbourhood and have problem in studying.
I told my friend about the same and asked her to help me in the matter.She laughed at me and said she would prefer doing something which will pay me and will give more enjoyment.
I didnt listen to her and started a common class at my home for my nieghbourhood children.I tierd improving their reading skills in which all were lacking.By reading anyone can go anywhere in the world without hesitation,can gain knowledge about various topics..Reading is an important factor which mostly parents and teachers overlook.It should be a general habit of every student which students dont realise in elementary classes.
Teenagers are more concerned about the parties and clubs but least bothered about the people around us.The attitude of is so rude towards elders and even youngers.We are educated and talented so we should take the best output from our education and knowledge by helping others.
Young generation coming up should think about others also,if not the whole world then atleast a minor part near to them to make some changes and improvement in the system.
Young people are the future of the country leading to the world' future.
I do agree that young people nowadays donot give anough time to help their communites and this can be changed only if an individual wants to change.",
"In my view ,it is better to have a knowledge on a specialize subject rather than having broader knowledge of many academic subjects because If the person is carrer oriented then he has to specialized in that particular field instead learning all the subjects which is a waste of time and money.This not only saves ones time but also gives the thorough and coherent knowledge and skills about that subject.
                        The reason that I agree with this point is that I have observed one of my Classmate who was very much interested in all the subjects and plus he was career oreinted too.He spends time gaining knowledge of the subjects .At last,when the real time came ,he was helpless and finally didnt succeed in his career .By seeing his expereince I have learnt that ""the more you learn,the more you forget"" and finally you will be remauned with a single pie in your hand.
        So knowledge in terms of academic aspects depends on your interest and career.So if you want acquire more knowledge ,you have to sacrifice the other part of life.By this a nice proverb can be evolved ""A bird in hand is worth than two ina bush"". This implies if you are interested in one particular field then stay tuned to that paricular field rather than showing interest in various activities.
           But some parts of the statements sounds sometimes true because through his knowledge only we acquire wisdom.If the person haves the knowledge with wisdom he can stand tall in life .For ex:- John Abraham .Through his wisdom only America Is successful today.
         Coming back to the point ,if one does his work in a specific and significant way ,he can achieve success,So I totally disagree with the statement ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one  subject"".",
"Many young people enjoy their life, but not every one enjoys it. 
Many people fails their life and does not enjoy their life. The happyness of life depends on what have the people done in their life to be happy and weather the people satisfied with the result. The statement that the young people enjoy life more than older people do can not be true at all of the situations.
   Most of the people has bad thing happens in their life. It could happen in any stage of the life. Some people has more than one bad memory which cause to a load of distress and depression. Many teenager has great amount of stresses caused by an academic, and sococial problem. Many teenager gets too much stresses and sometime,  those stresses leads to a suicide. 
   On the other hand, the old people, who retired or almost in time to retire has nothing to worry about, but their health. Worry is one of the boggest cause of diseases. the body does not function well when people worry too much. Old people has not a lot to worry about. But the Old people has higher percentage of being hurt, or die. Dying isn'y really bad if the person did everything they have wanted to do and if they are satisfied about their life, but not everyone satisfy about their life like stated in beginning of this essay.
   People wants something more at all the time. Youngsters wants to become and adult, older people regret about their life back in the past and wants to live their life again. Someone might like being old better than beign young. Not every body enjoys being young neither old. not every young people enjoys their life then an old people.",
"I disagree with the statement that argues most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I think most people are mislead by few aggressive opinions and blaming advertisements for wrong reasons.
	However, I admit that there are some advertisements, especially in food, hotels and restaurants, that try to make false impression on consumers by adding colors or increasing the volume  or showing pictures of long time ago.  But in most cases, I think most advertisement are honest about their products. Especially thanks to the arising public awareness, companies are being more careful to be truthful and honest when communicating to consumers through advertisements.
	The main purpose of advertisement is to make people want to consume or buy a product or service. In order to do that, advertisement focuses on getting attention to draw interest from consumers. That is why they use famous actors and actresses or flashy visuals or loud and upbeat music. But that does not have anything to do with making the product or service look better at all. If a pair of clothes looks better when it's put on by famous actress in an advertisement than by yourself, it is only your imagination that it looks better in the ad. These effects make people feel happy or imagine something fun which lead them to think that the product  looks good or beautiful. But it is important to be aware that it is not  because they did something to the product. Advertisements are only adding context to the product to let the people imagine something fun or beautiful and have that imagination relate to the product. When people watch or see advertisement, they should be aware of this effect to protect themselves from false impression caused by their own imagination.
	In addition to that, partly due to regulation, there are advertisements which describe not only the strength and benefit but also risk and weakness associated with the products such as prescription drugs. It seems contradictory to the main purpose of advertisement but in the end, honest communication should be paid off by trust and loyalty from consumers. I think the importance of honest communication between company and consumer are being recognized in the corporate world.",
"In the realm of education, the age-old debate between breadth and depth of knowledge continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization in a specific subject offers profound expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This perspective stems from the inherent advantages of a well-rounded education, which fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and a holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base cultivates intellectual curiosity and a thirst for lifelong learning. Exposure to diverse subjects, from history and literature to science and mathematics, expands one's horizons and ignites a passion for exploring new ideas. This intellectual curiosity is essential for personal growth and professional success, as it encourages individuals to constantly seek knowledge and adapt to evolving challenges. For instance, a historian with a strong understanding of economics might be better equipped to analyze the social and economic factors that shaped historical events.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability and critical thinking skills. In today's rapidly changing world, individuals need to be able to navigate diverse fields and solve complex problems. A well-rounded education equips individuals with the ability to connect seemingly disparate concepts, analyze information from multiple perspectives, and develop creative solutions. For example, a scientist with a background in philosophy might be better able to understand the ethical implications of their research.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous. It fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and a holistic understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, individuals can cultivate a lifelong love of learning, develop critical thinking skills, and become more well-rounded and adaptable members of society.",
"I agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to help their communities for the following reasons.

First, young people are less interested in the activities of their communities, although communities are indispensable for people to live. For example, I participate in a clean up activity around the central station of my city. This activity is held every week and young people live in my city is strongly encourage to join, however, there are few young people among the participants. This example clearly shows that young people do not spend enough time to help their communities.

Second, the vote rate of young people in elections in Japan is generally much less than that of elder people, although to join political process of the communities is impotant activity to keep their communities active and healthy. To join political process, the voter must have their opinion toward their commutities. If young people paticipate in their communities, they should have some opinion toward the situation or future of their communities, and they should have strong incentive to go voting. This is the reason why I think young people do not spend enough time to help their communities.

Third, there are many companies which help elder people with their house hold errands and chores. The copanies run  their customers errands instead of  instead of the elder people. This business increases because young people will not help their grand parents or their parents. 

Therefore, for above reasons, I agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many strive to make products seem far better than they truly are. This exaggeration, often achieved through clever marketing tactics, can be detrimental to consumers who are misled into believing unrealistic promises. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a beauty product advertisement might showcase a model with flawless skin, attributing the result solely to the product. However, the advertisement might fail to mention the need for consistent use, potential side effects, or the fact that the model's flawless skin might be due to professional makeup and lighting. This selective presentation creates an illusion of perfection that is rarely achievable in reality. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to sway consumers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, they associate these positive emotions with the product. A car advertisement might depict a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that purchasing the car will lead to similar experiences. However, the reality is that the car itself does not guarantee happiness or adventure. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive decisions based on unrealistic expectations. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, it is undeniable that many strive to make products seem much better than they really are. By employing tactics such as selective information and emotional appeals, advertisers create an illusion of perfection that can mislead consumers. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to approach advertisements with a critical eye, focusing on the actual features and benefits of a product rather than the exaggerated promises presented by the advertiser.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a generalization that overlooks the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, a significant number actively participate in various community initiatives, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led organizations focused on addressing social issues. From environmental activism to promoting literacy, young people are utilizing their skills and passion to create positive change. Take, for instance, the global movement of young climate activists who have mobilized millions to demand action against climate change. Their dedication and commitment to a cause greater than themselves are undeniable.
Furthermore, many young people contribute to their communities through volunteer work. They dedicate their time to local charities, soup kitchens, and animal shelters, providing essential support to those in need. These acts of kindness and compassion are often overlooked but demonstrate the genuine desire of young people to make a difference in their communities.
In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From leading social movements to volunteering their time, young people are actively engaged in creating a better world. To dismiss their efforts as insufficient is to overlook the significant impact they have on society.",
"Although many advertisements try to make some products seem better, I do not agree with that they are succesfull. Because the  advertisements can not hide the reality. Also people investigate the products  with all details before buying them. It is not very easy to make a product seem much better than they really are. So it may cause some problems which customer complain about.
Some advertisements may illustrate that their pruducts have awesome results. However, the truth can not be covered forever. If you buy something which promise a good result, you may be disappointed. Because you want to see the the results which they offer in their advertisement. When you see the reality which is opposite, you will not suggest this product and it will cause to decrease the number of customers which may want to try it.
Also many people investigate the products before buying. They read the comments which are about the products and they want to see some formal certificates which guarantee claims of products. So they do not believe easily to advertisements. After they finish their searchings about the products, they pay money for the products. 
The advertisements are used for informing people about new products and technologies. If advertisements do not reflect the realities, it can cause some problems. It can decrease the reputation of products. So the companies get difficulties to increase their profits.
I believe that most people agree with me. Since life gets harder and more expensive, People think second time before buying. So the advertisements can not be very efficient if they try to make the products much better.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local food drives to advocating for environmental sustainability, young people are using their creativity and passion to address pressing issues. The recent surge in climate change activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their commitment to making a difference.

Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time and skills to support various organizations. They dedicate hours to tutoring underprivileged children, assisting senior citizens, or working at animal shelters. These acts of service not only benefit the community but also foster personal growth and a sense of purpose in young individuals.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about an entire generation, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which young people contribute to their communities. From leading social movements to volunteering their time, they are actively shaping a better future. To dismiss their efforts as insufficient is to overlook the significant impact they have on society.",

"Young  people usually cost lots of time on computer,cell phone and go out for fun besides school and work time.But I don't think it means they do not give enough time to helping their communities.I think the communities can't separate form the common actives and people.Young people can learn a lot in friends,computer and somthing or someone they meet in life.

  For example,I always cost a lot of time on computer and interenet.I met many kinds of people online I will not find at school.I always can find new things from them.And I can aways get the news online when I want.But in the eyes of other people,maybe I just play the computer all dat and do not give enough time to helping my community.

  That is why I do not think young people they do  not give enought time to helping their communities.I think they just change their ways to do it.",
"The first questions that comes to my mind after reading that statement is ""Did people in the past spend more time helping their communities?"". To answer that question we should take a short look at the society in earlier times. A hundred years ago the communties where much smaller than these days. 300 years ago there was no supermarket in small villages. People had to work together to survive. The farmer had to grow food, the tailor had to produce clothes. Everyone was interested in getting the best out of what they were doing. Therefore they often contributed something to help their community. That has changed. Today a lot of people don't really care about their neighbors and/or surroundings. For example we have a big house with 6 floors. 20 Families are living in this house. The house is very dirty inside, when you step outside you can find dog's excrements everywhere. Neighbors call the police all the time, because they think their neighbor is too noisy. Here we can see that even in a small community like the house in my example is not working together. They are not helping eachother and instead try to make life harder for everyone around. The country Germany is another example for a community. We have many different provinces in this country and they usually don't work together that much. Every province tries to get the best result for themselves, but instead of doing that through helping other provinces and contributing something to the community they just try to get the most amount of money they can. So why is it that people nowadays do not spend a lot of time to help their communities? We all know that people have the time. People watch many hours T.V. everyday due to boredom. They could use that time to help the community. The problem is that a lot of people don't feel responsible for their community anymore. They see that the house is dirty, but they are not willing to do anything about it. Either because they think ""I'm not going to do it, someone else can do it."" or they think ""If nobody is cleaning it, why should I?"". A way to solve this issue could be to encourage people to contribute something for their community and make life better for everyone.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it's better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial in today's complex world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By understanding diverse perspectives and concepts, individuals can approach challenges from multiple angles, leading to more innovative and effective solutions. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the causes of historical events, while a scientist with a background in philosophy might be able to critically evaluate the ethical implications of their research.
Secondly, a broad education promotes adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. As technology advances and industries evolve, individuals with specialized knowledge may find themselves limited in their career options. However, those with a broad understanding of various disciplines can readily adapt to new demands and seize opportunities in different fields. For example, a graduate with a degree in literature could transition into a career in marketing or journalism, leveraging their strong analytical and communication skills.
Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches personal growth and intellectual curiosity. Engaging with diverse subjects expands our horizons, fosters empathy, and allows us to appreciate the interconnectedness of different disciplines. It encourages lifelong learning and a thirst for knowledge, making individuals more well-rounded and engaged citizens.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers numerous advantages. It promotes critical thinking, adaptability, and personal growth, making it a more valuable asset in today's dynamic world. By embracing a diverse range of knowledge, we equip ourselves to navigate the complexities of life and contribute meaningfully to society.",
"In my oppinion products seem better than they actually are in advertisemets, so I agree with the statement.

In order to make any inference about the advertisements we first have to consider why and by whom they are being produced. Adverstisements are for firms that wish to increase the sales of a product. Apart from a few exceptions, the number one priority for the modern firms of our time is profit making. Thus the advertisement's final objective is to increase the profit of the firm by increasing the number of goods being sold. In that regard the firm wants its product to look as good as possible on the TV, newspaper, billboards or any other medium which advertisements have infiltrated.  To that end the advertisement maker is likely to show only the things about the product  that he thinks will increase its sales and as a result what the consumer sees is not the final product but rather an idealised version of it.

Let me give an examples to better explain the previous paragraph. Imagine diet coke and advertisements about it. In those advertisements what we always see is good looking people, drinking diet coke and having fun. They almost always look good, are extremely happy on the advertisement. Does it reflect reality? Obviosly what made them that good looking is not diet coke, as any person will admit, but hard training.

Or think of a man in an advertisement who just bought his brand new car. He is driving on the countryside away from traffic jams and enjoying himself as most as possible away from the real world. But in reality he would be stuck in a trafic jam most probably and not bu that happy.

What the advertisements are trying to do is not giving information about the product, but rather trying to depict it in an ideal setting and make the consumer want it.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers profound expertise in a chosen field, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual flexibility, cultivates a holistic understanding of the world, and equips individuals with the adaptability necessary to thrive in an ever-evolving landscape.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas across disciplines, fostering innovative thinking and problem-solving. For instance, a historian with a grasp of economics might analyze historical events through a lens of economic factors, leading to novel interpretations. Similarly, a scientist with a background in literature might approach scientific research with a heightened awareness of the social and ethical implications of their work. This interdisciplinary approach enriches understanding and opens doors to new possibilities.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates a more comprehensive understanding of the world. By exploring diverse subjects, individuals gain insights into different cultures, perspectives, and ways of thinking. This exposure broadens their horizons, fostering empathy and tolerance. For example, studying philosophy alongside literature can provide a deeper understanding of human nature and the complexities of human experience.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more enriching and adaptable approach to learning. It fosters intellectual flexibility, cultivates a holistic understanding of the world, and equips individuals with the skills necessary to navigate the complexities of the 21st century. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, we can unlock our full intellectual potential and become more well-rounded individuals.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating one, filled with promises of enhanced lives and dazzling experiences. While some advertisements accurately portray products, many, in my opinion, exaggerate their benefits, creating an illusion of perfection that rarely matches reality. This tendency to embellish is driven by the desire to entice consumers and boost sales, often at the expense of truthful representation. 

One glaring example is the ubiquitous beauty industry. Advertisements for cosmetics and skincare products frequently feature models with flawless skin and impossibly youthful appearances. These images are often heavily edited, airbrushed, and digitally enhanced, creating an unrealistic standard of beauty that is unattainable for most people. This manipulation can lead to feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, as consumers strive to achieve an idealized look that is simply not achievable. 

Furthermore, advertisements for food products often use deceptive techniques to make their offerings seem more appealing than they truly are. For instance, images of burgers and fries are often meticulously styled with vibrant colors and strategically placed garnishes, making them appear more delicious and enticing than they would be in real life. This visual trickery can lead consumers to make unhealthy choices, as they are misled by the exaggerated presentation of the food. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements strive for honesty and accuracy, many fall prey to the temptation to embellish and exaggerate. This tendency to present products in a more favorable light than they deserve can have negative consequences, leading to unrealistic expectations, feelings of inadequacy, and potentially unhealthy choices. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to approach advertisements with a critical eye, recognizing that the reality of a product may not always align with its idealized portrayal.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, the social pressures of fitting in and navigating complex relationships can contribute to stress and uncertainty. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find excitement in new experiences and adventures, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from quiet moments of reflection and appreciation for the simple things in life. For example, a young person might find joy in traveling to a new country, while an older person might find contentment in spending time with loved ones or pursuing a hobby. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not solely dependent on age. Both young and old individuals have the potential to experience happiness and fulfillment, albeit in different ways. It is important to recognize the unique challenges and joys that come with each stage of life and appreciate the diverse perspectives that contribute to a rich and meaningful existence.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas across disciplines. For instance, a historian with an understanding of economics can better analyze the impact of trade on historical events. Similarly, a scientist with a background in philosophy can critically evaluate the ethical implications of their research. This interdisciplinary approach leads to more nuanced and insightful perspectives.
Furthermore, a broad education equips individuals with greater adaptability in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals with diverse skills and the ability to learn new things quickly. A person with a broad knowledge base is more likely to thrive in such an environment, as they can readily apply their understanding to different situations.
Finally, a broad education fosters intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. When exposed to a variety of subjects, individuals are more likely to develop a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore new ideas. This intrinsic motivation is essential for personal growth and intellectual fulfillment.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and adaptable approach to learning. It fosters interdisciplinary thinking, adaptability, and a lifelong love of learning, ultimately leading to a more well-rounded and intellectually stimulating life.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it is true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits over community involvement, countless others are actively engaged in making a positive impact. 

One compelling example of young people's commitment to their communities is the rise of youth-led social initiatives. From organizing environmental clean-up drives to advocating for social justice causes, young people are utilizing their energy and creativity to address pressing issues. Many dedicate their time to volunteering at local shelters, food banks, or hospitals, providing essential support to those in need. These actions demonstrate a genuine desire to contribute to the well-being of their communities.
Furthermore, the digital age has empowered young people to amplify their voices and reach a wider audience. Through online platforms, they can raise awareness about important issues, mobilize support for charitable causes, and connect with like-minded individuals to create impactful change. This online activism allows young people to contribute to their communities on a global scale, transcending geographical boundaries.
In conclusion, while it is easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it is crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From traditional volunteer work to online activism, young people are actively engaged in making a difference. Their dedication and commitment to creating a better world should be acknowledged and celebrated.",
"I agree with the statement, that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are. Industries only want to sell their products. Especially in TV advertisments the marketing directors of a company only want to show, how positive the product is and that everybody needs it at home.
First of all, companys want to sell.  They want to earn money. That is why they exist. What people really need is not nescessary for them. They only want custumers to buy their own products. 
The second point is, that TV Ads only show how positive a product is. Negative things, like high rated prizes are often not in the advertisments. 
Companies onlzx show how positiv a product is. Thez also sell dreams. For example: Ten naked girls running on a beach on a boy, who looks ugly and has the product in his hands. Today that is a normal TV Spot. With the product of this specific company the ugly guy will get one of the girls for a date. The advertisment will tell me that, but that is just not the truth. Companies want to sell dreams, which have nothing to do with the truth. 
Marketing directors of companies also wants the customer to tell, that there is a product what they really need at home and for themselves. Everthing in advertisments is positive. Faced by this fact, it shows that  the products in TV Spots should be better than they are in reality. The reality do not exist in advertisments. That is a fact.
All that reasons are important for me, why i agree with the statement, that advertisments make prducts seem much better than they really are. Somebody who disagree has no idea about companies and their tricks to sell the highest numbers of products, which are possible.",
"In this text i will discuss the question "" Young people enjoy life more than older people do"".At first I have to say that everybody will be old at one day and this is my first argument. 
When young people think ""I will be old sometime""
they often think on ""but not yet and I have anough time to enjoy my life!"". Then the young people often do something forbiddin or something ""freaky"". For example I read about parcour. Parcour means that you run accros a city and always run straight on even if there are cars, garages and houses.  You just climb up the wall and than jump down and that is what many young people do.
For older people enjoying life is often spending time with the family, go traviling and reading something in what they are intrested.
For example cannot everybody remebres his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parents would have never allowed or something like that?
And most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotels?
Older people most just enjoy their life. But the young people are often not allowed to do the things they want to do and often the parents are the reason for that.
So the real question is who actually can enjoy his life?
but this would take to long so i will write my oppinion on the question ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do""
I think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do.
I think that, because i often hear storys about oler people beeing very ill or having pain everywhere and like this you can't enjoy life.
Young people often do forbidden things and that gives them a kick and the thing with girlfriends is although giving young peoples a feeling of enjoying their life. So i think Young people can enjoy life more than older people do.",
"Nowadays it is considered as a very popular topic that one should have knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one topic. Many people ignores this topic but it is very important for the university students and ones who have an aim to have an academic career. 
	Opponents of the idea 'having one specific subject' consider that one should have relative subjects like maths and physics, so when they see an Integral in the middle of a physics lesson, they should avoid the problems with ease. Moreover they think that one can earn much money when s/he has two or more subjects. In addition to that it will ease the communication between student and teacher, when they have many things to talk about.
	Although in first sight it is seen that one should have many academic subjects, it is not like it is seen. First of all one should know a lot of things about Maths if she/he is a physician. So s/he doesn't have to make longer his/her study and be also an mathematician. It will bore the teacher when s/he is young and a university student and s/he can change his/her plan being an academician. 
	In addition to that it is always considered that one can earn a lot of money when s/he has two or more subjects. The answer is simple:No! The academicians are paid by the hours that they teach. No one pay you much money even if you have ten subjects or one. The payment is always the same.
	Thirdly physicians don't have to know much about psychology. Because thay have no time to spend with another subject for just finding a topic with students to talk about. If they want to talk about something they can talk about football matches, TV programs etc..
	At last we should consider that academicians are busy people and they are being waited for the researches and new technologies. The second subject will reduce the chance of discover the new part of the modern life because thay won't have time and energy to focus on the new researches. If everyone could do just his/her own job, the world would have been probably different and lovely..",
"To my mind, I think young and old people enjoy life from different ways.
First of all, it is true that young people enjoy life because they are very optimist..they do not take care about problems of the world; they just only leave their life..
For instance, at the age of 20, young people like me are very happy. We think that we are invincible and we think that in the future we will not have problems like our parents for example.
Then, a lot of people and not only young people, think that having 20 is a good thing, this is the best periode..This is the age of love, sexual experience, jod experience, holidays experience without parents.... In fact, it is the age of discover... Everything is new and interesting.....So there is no way for young people to learn about life, only just by enjoy life.
But if young people enjoy life, there is also old people who enjoy it.
That`s true....When old people retired from their job, they have a lot of moments for them.... they can travel.... they are not obliged to wake up every morning in order to go to work....And most of the time, they enjoy life more than youger people.
For example, my grand mother is very happy to be in the category of the old people..... When she was young, she could not travel because she had to work...and before, life was not the same as nowadays... But today, with her association of her subburb, she can travel where she wants.... In addition, since she`s retired from her job, she has travelled every where; Egypt, Spain, Italy, Turkey... and so on... She travels a lot... And a lot of retired people or old people are in this case...
So we can say that to be old it is a sort of a second life where people discover again some things, where they learn again about technology, science, culture, and also about young people..
So, in conclusion, we can say that there is not a lot of differences between young and old people and personnaly, I have never met  a personn who did not enjoy life.                                                                   I use is to say  LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL SO ENJOY IT....",
"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Many companies will do any possible things for their advertisements to make their products much more popular in the society, but do not care about the real value of the produsts.
       There are millions of kinds of advetisements on TV, radio, newspaper, magzines, or even mails. These various pictures and commits of the products are seemed much better than they really are. It is because that the companies want to make their products more popular in the society. For instance, BurgerKing will make advertisements to show how healthy their burgers or frech fry are; however, the fact is that any junk food is no good for health.
        The advertisements about toys are the most popular one on the TV, since kids can not read yet and the careness parents always make their kids' requirements come ture; the companies of toys are make millions of cartoon characters or games which based on the cartoons every year. But sometimes the real produsts are not as valuable as the commercial shows on the TV. It means that the companies do not respect the consumers' rights to purchase right and great products.
         On the other hand, advertisements of mechane of shape wonderful body are always fake, that nobody could just use the mechanes for several months to recreate their bodise which heritate from their parents. According to the health knowledge, a person's body shape determened by the heritation from his/her own parents; the excercise can only help the person to make his/her body much more healthier and stronger.
         Thus, most of the advertisements contain many fakeness, people should be aware about the negetive effects of the advertisements. Meanwhile the companies should carefully think about the real purpose of making advertisements.",
"I am now 20 years old. Older people would say I am very young to understand the society as an adult. Younger people would say I am enough old to go out of family and experience the world. 
	In the year 2006, many things happened to me. I went to the United States of America for the first time, and have been a student in a college. I had to experience everything in a foreign language, English. Imagine, It still might have been hard if I was a student in my country, but i had to do in a foreign country. It gave me new experiences in my life. I had to make my decisions by my own. My family and my friends were too far from me to give advise. It was a hard year for me. 
	So younger people enjoy their life more than older people do. Young people might feel the world and think in their own ways but they still stay in a particular places like house, school or by their friends. They would also don't know exatly what is happening in the world, What they do everyday is playing, hanging out with their friends and do their duty as children in their family. 
	When they grow up and become old people, they might have many things to consider in their lifes. They have to consider about money problems, have to consider about their children, have to think about their future and so on. Also they will find out that the world is not so easy to live than they were expected when they were children. 
	In conclusion, younger people will enjoy more their life than older people do, because they have less things to care about and does not know how hard the world is to live as a human beings.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that overlooks the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various avenues. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led climate change activism showcases their dedication to environmental sustainability. These young activists organize protests, raise awareness, and advocate for policy changes, demonstrating their commitment to creating a better future for their communities. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to make a difference. Many young individuals are using their technological expertise to develop innovative solutions for community challenges. For example, young programmers are creating mobile applications that connect volunteers with local organizations, facilitating efficient and impactful community service. This demonstrates that young people are not only willing to volunteer their time but also actively seeking ways to leverage their abilities for the greater good. 

In conclusion, while some young people may not be actively involved in traditional forms of community service, it is unfair to generalize that they are not contributing. Young people are actively engaged in various ways, from volunteering to utilizing their skills to create positive change. Their dedication to improving their communities is evident in their actions and their commitment to a better future. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people are contributing to their communities and recognize their valuable contributions.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a complex one. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial in today's rapidly evolving world.


Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By understanding concepts from various disciplines, individuals can approach challenges from multiple perspectives. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the causes of historical events, while a scientist with a background in literature might be more adept at communicating complex research findings. This interdisciplinary approach allows for more comprehensive and innovative solutions. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability and resilience in a constantly changing world. In today's job market, skills are becoming increasingly fluid, and individuals need to be able to adapt to new technologies and challenges. A broad education provides a foundation for lifelong learning, enabling individuals to acquire new skills and knowledge throughout their careers. For example, a person with a broad understanding of technology might be able to transition from a traditional engineering role to a data science position with relative ease. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches our lives and fosters a deeper understanding of the world around us. By exploring different subjects, we gain a greater appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge and the complexities of human experience. This broadened perspective allows us to engage in meaningful conversations, appreciate diverse viewpoints, and contribute to a more informed and tolerant society. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more holistic and adaptable approach to learning and life. It fosters critical thinking, enhances adaptability, and enriches our understanding of the world. Therefore, I believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",
"Advertising consists of convincing potential customers that a given commodity or service has some positive qualities that make it worth buying.
In some cases the advertised features of the product either exist or not. For example, it is relatively easy to verify whether a claim stated in a commercial that - under some conditions- a car runs on some amount of gas per 100 kilometers can be true or not. In this case advertising can make the commodity seem better than it is. However, to my knowledge, these forms of advertisement are mostly forbidden in developed countries, since they essentially represent scams.
In many - perhaps most - other cases, the qualities claimed in a commercial cannot be univocally defined as true or faulse. For example, a company could advertise a drink it markets as, say, the ""drink of the coolest people on earth"". In itself, this statement means nothing and cannot be verified. However, if the advertising campaign is well designed and a number of people accept the view that drinking that specific drink makes you ""cool"", then advertising - to some extent - creates the feature it claims.
In such cases, advertising changes the product itself and is part of it. That is, a given item without advertising is in fact a different product than the otherwise identical item which has been advertised. Therefore I would not agree with the statement that advertising makes products seem much better than they are in fact.",
"I can't make a clear decision wether i agree the statement or not, because it depends on the product and especially on the brand. 
I think that products and brands being popular and well known won't cheat with their advertisment. One reason is that the quality of most of this products is so high that there is no need for the enterprises to lie. A second reason is that the enterprises harm their image if they promise something their product can't fulfill.
But on the other side new or unknown brands which will conquer a market can't survive if they won't get humans attention. That's why many enterprises have to make big promises to attract the consumers view. Examples can be seen daily in TV or in the written media. 
In our days I think I tend a bit more to the fact that I won't agree with the statement. In the time of internet there is a high transparancy concerning the quality of goods. Statements of people who used the product could be looked up and so if one product has bad critics the enterprise could be kicked out of business.
Furthermore there are several institutions like the German "" Stiftung Warentest"" which test products to give a neutral statement, and people give much upon their opinion.
Last but not least the legal situation for businesses is more difficult. So there is only a small path between what is legal exageration and what is illegal cheating. 
So the risk to harm the business, for an enterprise, is big enough that most of them won't make their products better than they realy are because there is a lot of danger in being punished by the state or even the consumers.",

Finally, young people are increasingly involved in formal community service programs. Schools, universities, and youth organizations offer opportunities for students to volunteer their time and skills to local communities. These programs provide valuable experiences that foster empathy, responsibility, and a sense of civic duty. By participating in these programs, young people gain a deeper understanding of community needs and develop the skills necessary to make a positive impact.

"Today we face a world where millions of products are competing for the attention of paying customers around the world. Competition increases as new products and technologies enter the marketplace on a daily basis. These products must stand out from the rest in order to catch the eye of the consumer, extra value must be added to differentiate one from the millions of similar products available. 
	The marketing and advertisement industry has grown significantly thanks to our consumerist culture. They are in charge of a product's promotion and recognition strategies , and often they are responsible for its success or failure as well. In this battlefield, advertising agencies must make use of every possible weapon they can find in order to appeal to their customer's wants and needs. This is where false claims of greatness and exaggerated qualities are attached to average products. I think most advertisements and marketing campaigns make products and services seem better than what they really are, they must do this in order to stay in business. 

	Customers are easily fooled by false claims of great quality,  marketing strategies transform ""wants"" into ""needs"", driving the consumer into a buying frenzy. Fashion is also a key element when it comes to consumption patterns worldwide. People are made to believe they need something ""never seen before"" in order to make them happy or successful or popular. Once again, products are made to seem as something extraordinary everybody wants to have. At the end, it's just as good (or bad) as the next product on the shelve.

	Often, a little ""extra"" is added to a product in order to satisfy the customer. Good promotion and marketing strategies are sometimes defficient when there is great offer and not much demand for a specific object or service in the market. Lying and exaggeration come again into place when trying to make a sell, you have to give the customer what he's asking for, even if it is not true. Sometimes people just like to read or hear or see what they want to, if you can be the one to provide it to them you might have a chance to stay on top for a day or two util the competition catches up.",
"It is difficult to answer this question. Young people have all their lifes ahead, everything is new. They have their dreams that they hold on to, and they are, usually, full of hope.
Older people on the other hand, have learned a lot already, and acquiered some wisdom. They see life and certain things like love less complicated. They had their experiences and are much cooler than when they were young.
But young people have the advantage to be healthier and full of power and strength to live their youth and to make experiences themselfes.
Older people are more likely to get sick and to feel tired and weak.
So maybe their bodys are not what they used to be.
But the expierences they made and what they have learned about life and about themselfes helps them to take it easy.
Their mind is stronger.
A old man laughs about this childish young guy who is so desperatly in love that he is not able to eat or to think, because he can only think of his girl. But he also envies him for being so strong and active and to have such intense feelings.
This is something he lost on his way becoming a mature man.
Being young is an adventure, and you may enjoy it or you may regret it. It is full of action and impressions, but for me, maybe because I m young and have not experienced being old, i still believe that the future, in wich i will be old, offers me plenty of happyness.
It will be different, though.
I am quite sure it depends on every single person whether they are happier when they are young or old.
But I have to admit, that even if I think that it only gets better, most of the old people miss their youth very much. 
But it can be joyfull to remember to!
I think you should enjoy every age.
But as the youth is more intense, I think that for most people the youth is the part of their lifes that they enjoy the most.",
"Basically, I agree with the statement.  However, there are some points to be made clear still, such as, for who advertisemtns make products seem much better than they really are and to what extent.  In the following text, I will clarify why I agree with this statement, clarifying these points.
	It is true that we sometimes have a feeling that some advertisement are overselling their products in their commercial.  For example, the commercial of movie usually shows the best part of the movie in the advertisement, and makes us excited and looking forward to this movie, but sometimes it happens that we get disappinted with it after seeing the movie itself.  
	However, if there is actually overdoing of advertisement are different according to different receiver.  If we take an example of coffee, if you do not drink coffee at all, the quality of coffee does not matter to you.  In this case, for you non of the advertisement is overdoing, because from the first of all, you do not expect any quality from the advertisement.  So my point is that if a certain advertisement is overdoing or not is depending on the person who are interested in and evaluates the product.
	Besides, the degree of overdoing is also depending on the receiver as well.  If you go to some internet site where the opinion of certain product, such as camera, or MP3 player are publically open, you can see various types of opinion toward the same product.  Sometimes they can be totally opposite, such that some say, it was worthwhile to buy, and the other say it had been better to throw money away.  So for those who are satisfied with the product, the advertisement of this product is not overdoing, but for those who are not satisfied with quality of the product, will take the advertisement overdone.  
	To sum up,  although depending on who the receiver of the advertisement is the statement might not be true in some cases, and the degree of overdoing varies across the evaluaters or consumers, 
I agree that most of the time, the statement is true.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, the social pressures of fitting in and navigating complex relationships can contribute to stress and uncertainty. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find excitement in new experiences and adventures, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from the comfort of routine and the wisdom gained through years of experience. For example, a young person might find joy in traveling to a new country, while an older person might find contentment in spending time with their grandchildren. 

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that happiness is not a constant state. Both young and old individuals experience periods of joy and sorrow, and the ability to navigate these emotions is a crucial aspect of a fulfilling life. While young people may have a more carefree outlook, older individuals have developed coping mechanisms and resilience that can contribute to their overall well-being. 

In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification. Both age groups experience a range of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life.

"Specialization is a tool used by all companies and sometimes even countries. There are many people who would prefer being ""average"" in multiple jobs then being incredible in one certain aspect of a job; they might have a valid arguements but if you look at this statement from a business view, every successful person should have a broad knowledge on many difference academic subjects but there will always be one aspect that they prefer and are better at then any other. 
	This is a statement that expresses difference opinions but I personally believe that everyone should specialize in one certain critiria in order to have the best possible outcome. The reasons that I have concluded from that if no one specialized is one certain area of a job then what would make a product so different and more valuable than any other product in that market. If you take fashion designers as an example, they specialize in one certain aspect like hand-bags or jewellary but also design other products like dresses.
	To specialize in one certain subject does not mean you have no other information or knowledge in anything else but simply states that you are better at one subject than anything else. If I could be a successful doctor, I would specialize in curing diseases like AIDS and Cancer but does not mean I would not preform surgeries on cardiac patients; I would always have an overview on medicine in general.
	People will always be more interested in more certain subject, like a favorite subject in school but also take other subjects as well. This is the point that I am getting to, specializing in one specific subject with a brief overview of other subjects is the best way to live your life, it is like killing two birds with one stone and having the cake and eating it two. 
	To conclude this essay, my personal opinion is clearly stated and I agree with this statement and how important it is. If no one specialized then we would be living in a boring and dull life with no genuine enviroment. Always be good at many things but there should always be something you are great at.",
"I do not agree with the question.

The major reason that brought me to this conclusion is, that only specialisation makes perfect. That means if you want to work in a certain field, you have to specialize. Because you have to know as much as possible about this certain field, in order to work on a highly professional level. For example, if you are a doctor, you should learn everything about medicine, the human body and how to treat sicknisses. If you only know how to treat a cold and how to measure the blood pressure, you can not work on a high level. 
To give another example; If a programmer would not specialize, he or she will never find a job. Because there is such a great variety of programming languages, that only specialisation will make it possible to work in a certain field. There is no general programming! A programmer has to choose one field to work in, maybe web-designe, than he or she has to studie a lot in order to get a good overview about this particular working field. 

I think you can transfer this to every kind of academic subject. Only specialisation makes perfect.

But it is also my opinion, that people should have a broad knowledge of many different subjects. Not especially on academic level, but a good general knowledge is important as well.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a matter of ongoing debate. While specialization offers in-depth understanding and expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in today's interconnected world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Exposure to diverse subjects allows individuals to see connections and patterns that might not be apparent from a narrow perspective. For example, a student with knowledge of history, economics, and psychology can better understand the complexities of social issues and develop more nuanced solutions. 

Secondly, a broad education promotes adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. The job market is constantly evolving, and individuals with specialized skills may find themselves unprepared for new demands. A broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to learn new skills quickly and adapt to changing circumstances. For instance, a person with a broad understanding of technology, communication, and business principles can transition more easily between different roles and industries.
Finally, a broad education fosters intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. Exposure to diverse subjects stimulates the mind and encourages individuals to explore new ideas and perspectives. This curiosity can lead to personal growth, intellectual fulfillment, and a deeper understanding of the world around us. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in today's complex and ever-changing world. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a lifelong love of learning, ultimately equipping individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the 21st century.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that most advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods and services, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, the vast majority of advertisements employ persuasive techniques to make products seem far more appealing than they truly are. 

One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is exaggeration. They often use hyperbole and superlative language to inflate the perceived value of a product. For example, a shampoo advertisement might claim that it will make hair “silky smooth and unbelievably shiny,” even though the actual results may be far less dramatic. This exaggeration creates unrealistic expectations that are rarely met by the product itself. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on selective information and misleading imagery. They may focus on the most appealing aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a fast-food commercial might showcase a juicy burger and crispy fries, but it will likely avoid mentioning the high calorie content or the use of artificial ingredients. This selective presentation creates a distorted view of the product, making it seem more desirable than it actually is. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may provide accurate information, the vast majority employ deceptive tactics to make products appear more appealing than they truly are. Exaggeration, selective information, and misleading imagery are just a few of the techniques used to create a false impression of quality and desirability. Consumers should be aware of these tactics and exercise caution when making purchasing decisions based solely on advertising.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products and services. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of products, making them appear far superior to their actual capabilities. This essay will explore the reasons behind this phenomenon, drawing upon specific examples to illustrate my point. 

One of the primary reasons why advertisements often present an idealized version of reality is the pursuit of profit. Advertisers are driven by the desire to sell their products, and they often employ persuasive techniques to entice consumers. This can involve using exaggerated claims, selective information, and emotionally charged imagery to create a sense of desirability and urgency. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might feature a before-and-after image of a person who has dramatically transformed their physique, implying that the product is the sole reason for their success. However, the reality is that such transformations often involve a combination of factors, including diet, exercise, and genetics. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on the power of suggestion and association to create a positive perception of their products. By associating their products with desirable qualities, such as beauty, success, or happiness, advertisers aim to evoke emotional responses in consumers. For example, a perfume advertisement might feature a glamorous model in a luxurious setting, suggesting that using the perfume will make the consumer feel equally sophisticated and alluring. However, the reality is that the product itself may not possess any inherent qualities that can actually enhance one's attractiveness or social status. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may provide accurate information about products, the majority tend to exaggerate their qualities to create a more appealing image. This is driven by the pursuit of profit and the use of persuasive techniques that exploit consumer desires and emotions. By recognizing the manipulative nature of advertising, consumers can make more informed decisions and avoid falling prey to unrealistic expectations.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize their own pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives addressing social issues. From organizing environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice, young people are using their voices and skills to create positive change. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young people like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their commitment to making a difference.

Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time to various organizations. They dedicate hours to supporting local charities, mentoring underprivileged children, or assisting elderly individuals. These acts of selfless service demonstrate a genuine desire to contribute to the well-being of their communities.
While it's important to recognize the challenges faced by young people in today's world, such as academic pressure and financial constraints, it's equally crucial to acknowledge their dedication to community service. The statement that they do not give enough time is simply not accurate. Young people are actively shaping their communities, proving that they are not only concerned about their own futures but also about the well-being of others.",
"I agree that most young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. There should be an energy when the young people around the neighborhood, but nowadays they don't care about the enviroment they live.It is sad that people can't see young people to attend the activities of their communities. The reasons that make this situation are competition, education and value.

	First, competition is the main reason that young people don't want to participate any activities. There are more stress on their shoulder, such as academic assignment and making friends. They want to be the best and performance well in the school to get into the best senior high or colleges. It is usually that most of the young students in Taiwan will go to cram school after their daily classes.  They have to sacrifice their playing times to reach their goal. They  try to get in a public university for  the tuition are higher than before. There are many people may not afford it. What a stress on them and it makes young people can't not help their communities.
	Second, there is something wrong with education. Young people didn't get the right messages from eductions. As long people live in a place and a society, they do have responsibility to participate any activity and share their view. Just like a family, there are four members in the family, and everyone should share the chore with each other, not just parents only. When people get involve with it, they will feel belonging and more thoughtful for others. But it seems that the education policy doesn't emphasize the important of paticipating and concerning our society. Young tudents  only know their personal goal and studing for theirselves. It's too narrow for young k",
"Helping the communities is a current problem. There are more and more people need help in our communities. But we are living in an age with less attention and concern for the community versus an increased for one's owns needs and pleasures.
  
  In fact, there are more old people. The human body seems to be more resistant than before. Medicine are more elaborate. Some of them live alone far away or near  their family. Some of them can not be award over the new technologic. So they need help, sometimes only for speaking and walking. 

  Besides there exist unalfabetic people yet. I have heard that one by ten people in Belgium is unalfabetic, it's enormous. These people need help too. There exist associations. 

  Finally, something is very important for me and communities is the respect. If everybody respects each other a lot of problems in our communities will disappear. Respect between student and teacher, police and citzens, with authorities,... With doing I think that it's a big step for communities. It's not difficult and I would add that's a basic thing.
 
  Here you are a lot of things that you can do to helping your communities. You can notice that I said 'you can do' without specified who's you. In fact, I agree with this statement. But I would clarify that it's a problem for anybody who live in a community, not only for young people but also for adults.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth often possesses an exuberance and lack of responsibility that can lead to carefree moments, claiming they experience more joy is an oversimplification. Both young and old can find fulfillment and happiness in life, though their paths and perspectives differ significantly. 

Firstly, youth often enjoys a sense of boundless possibility. They are free from the constraints of career, family, and financial obligations that can weigh heavily on older generations. This freedom allows them to explore new experiences, pursue passions, and embrace spontaneity. However, this freedom can also be a double-edged sword. The lack of experience and stability can lead to uncertainty, anxiety, and a constant striving for something more. 

Conversely, older individuals have accumulated wisdom, experience, and a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. They have weathered life's storms, learned from their mistakes, and developed a sense of contentment that comes with age. This allows them to appreciate the simple pleasures, build meaningful relationships, and find joy in the present moment. For example, a seasoned artist may find immense satisfaction in their craft, while a grandparent may derive immense joy from spending time with their grandchildren. 

In conclusion, while youth may have a certain carefree energy, it is inaccurate to suggest they experience more joy than older individuals. Both young and old can find happiness in life, but their paths and perspectives differ. Ultimately, the key to enjoying life lies not in age, but in finding meaning and purpose, embracing challenges, and appreciating the beauty of each stage of life.",
"I agree with the statement that most adevertisements make products seem much better than they really are. As a matter of fact, I believe that this is precisely the whole purpose of advertising: convincing potential consumers of the good qualities or advantages of a specific product or item. It is the ultimate goal that the consumer, buyer, or customer does what is being recommended in the ad. 
Unfortunately, people in advertisement business may use all sort of techniques to sound convincing and be effective, which goes from mentioning only good qualities -and exclude those which are not so good- to emphasizing the bad qualities of alternative products or services. For example, any shampoo advertisement will claim that it will make hair get shinier, glossier, and easy to handle in, probably ""no time"". Is it true? If we carried out a research to classify hair products (just to choose any product) into those which are effective and those which are not, we would probably end up with a ration of 1 to 9. For one effective shampoo, there are 9 which ""claim"" to be but they are not. 
As consumers, advertisements have made us less gullible and more alert, as well as more careful when we make decisions on the basis of impressions created by advertisements. By making a comparison, advertisements are similar to the reflection on a rear-view mirror, reason why a sticker reads ""objects in rear view mirror are closer than they appear"". We need to widen the use of this statement to many other contexts. 
I personally think that, although there are regulations to control the advertising business in terms of using true/untrue statements and claiming results that they don't actually deliver and sometimes even cause others, there is a strong need for further more-detailed regulations regarding the use of misleading techniques which make consumers make wrong decisions. Consumers should be better protected because most advertisements use questionable technoques which manipulate the truth and that is dishonesty.

"Which is better, to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs or to specialize in a one specific subject? The answer really lies in the context in which you are speaking. 
	If you are still in school then it is always better to have a broad knowledge of all other subjects. Just imagine what a person will become if he study only Biology his whole life. He will never become a doctor, let alone a successful doctor. There are some subjects or fields of study which are necessary or form a base for further studies in any field. You can never succeed in life as a doctor if you don't have any knowledge of Chemistry or Maths.  We do need elementary knowledge of all the subjects to truly appriciate the subject in which we want to specialize. But at the same time we cannot expect a person doind PhD in Biology to know about difficult topics in Mathematics like Calculus. 
	Infact, the matter of fact is that as we move towards higher education, we should tend to concentrate on less and less subjects.  A person studing engineering, will usually do away with the subjects of History and Geography in College, but will still embrace Physics and Chemistry which are more relevant for him.  A person doing specialitaion must have pretty good knowledege of the subjects which are going to help him and facilitate him in his reaearch even though they are not directly related to his field of specialization.   
	 In conclusion I would like to say that we need a balance of both the forms. One one hand, in order to really understand and enjoy a subject we need to specialize in it, but at the same point we cannot afford to neglect other subjects. A good combination of both  broad knowledeg as well as specialized knowledge  will make a truly knowledgable person.",
"In todays world of information overload the specialist are much more neccesary than the generalist in order to further take steps in our technological development. 
  Fisrt off all although it neccesary to see the wide picture when faced with the problems the solution to the problem relies on specific knowledge of the problem. For instance an academician with wide range of knowledge in engineering may easily realize the problem in assembeling a robot where knowledge from several fields engineering is needed much more quicker than a specifically trained engineer who can point out the problems associated with his special knowledge. With his wide range of knowledge he can say that the electrical circuitrary is not working correctly. But in order the fix the problem he has to need help from an electrical engineering.
  Secondly a in todays world information is very extensive for one to collect and digest. People have to specilaze on one subject. The development of technology forces us to specialize in onet. In the early days of humanity it is logical to expect an academician to know everything about the all science fields. But nowadays things are getting much more complicated that one can handle. We have diverse society to many fields and wait them to communicate each other. 
 Last but least you can see many people having diverse knowledge about all issues but not specified in one of those. Those people are not valued by the humanity and no one can remember them in future. For instance a primary school teacher have to have broad knowledge of all science fields. He is just the first step of the development. Although he is essential for the maintainance of the development he can not add new bricks to the scientific literature. As you progress in your academic studies you can also realize that academiciens getting more and more specialized. Those academicians are at the top of the development that struggle for the research. Those will be remembered because of their support to the science.

    All in all specialist are much more needed in our society where it is impossible for one to digest all information. Specialist are the people who we are bound to in technological development. I cannot deny the importance of the generalists but they just constitute the basic of the building. If we want to build new floors we have to promote specialists.",
"It is undeniable that advertising plays a significant role in our consumerist society. While it can inform us about new products and services, many argue that most advertisements exaggerate the benefits of their offerings, making them appear far superior to reality. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as countless examples demonstrate the manipulative tactics employed by advertisers to entice consumers. 

One of the most common techniques used is the selective presentation of information. Advertisements often focus on the most appealing aspects of a product, highlighting its positive features while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss supplement might showcase a slim and toned individual, claiming miraculous results without mentioning the possible side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise. This selective portrayal creates an unrealistic expectation, leading consumers to believe that the product will magically solve their problems. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to sway viewers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or even fear, they create a sense of urgency and desirability around their products. A car commercial, for example, might depict a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that purchasing the advertised vehicle will bring them joy and freedom. This emotional manipulation can overshadow rational decision-making, prompting consumers to make impulsive purchases based on fleeting feelings rather than practical needs. 

In conclusion, the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are holds true. By selectively presenting information, employing emotional appeals, and often resorting to misleading claims, advertisers create a distorted perception of reality, leading consumers to make uninformed decisions. It is crucial to be aware of these tactics and approach advertising with a critical eye, focusing on objective information and considering the potential downsides before making any purchase.",
"In a contemporary society, someone who is specialized in one specific subject is more competent, and is more needed than someone who has broad knowledge on general topics. The current techniques are getting more complicated and the competition is getting more intense as the time goes on. Therefore, it is more likely recomendable to devote a specific field of study or work and to be highly qualified on it.

  First, the current field of researches, such as computer science and electronic technology, which dominate the development of a current society, need very deft and highly qualified skills and knowledges. These fields of products changes actually every minute. Cellphone which produced early this year is already outmoded and 2 year-old laptop is not producing anymore. Moreover, it is getting common to access Internet with phones and laptops everywhere, and can do whatever I want, like watching TV, movies, or chatting on line with my friends. Therefore, intensive and specialized skills and knowlege on electronic and mobile technology are desperately needed these days.

  Secondly, artists are getting more praised and encouraged because Art amuse people and help them have a stable metal health. Thus, high


  In conclusion, being a specialist on a certain field is more remarkable and worthable to improve our society. General information can be accessed by everyone who can watch TV or can use Internet. If I want to survive from the harsh competition of the current society, I need to devote to a certain field of research or business, and be a specialist who has unique information or skill.",

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's horizons is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts across different disciplines. For example, a historian with a grasp of economics can better understand the social and economic factors that shaped historical events. Similarly, a scientist with knowledge of literature can analyze the impact of scientific discoveries on societal values and beliefs. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of complex issues.
Secondly, a broad education equips individuals with greater adaptability and flexibility in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals with diverse skills and the ability to learn new things quickly. A broad knowledge base provides a solid foundation for acquiring new skills and adapting to new challenges. For instance, a student with a background in both science and humanities can transition seamlessly between careers in research and communication.
Finally, a broad education cultivates intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. By exploring different subjects, individuals develop a thirst for knowledge and a desire to continuously expand their understanding of the world. This lifelong learning attitude is essential for personal growth and intellectual fulfillment.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers numerous advantages. It fosters interdisciplinary thinking, adaptability, and a lifelong love of learning, ultimately leading to a richer and more fulfilling intellectual journey.",
"Nowadays, many people can see lots of advertisements. that is very effected to people. so, making an advertisement is very important for the company. I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
First,  a purpose of advertising a product is to sell more. so, they can add some lie in order to sell more. For example, I remembered that one company make an advertisement for a hair shampoo. In the TV, the advertisement introdce that when I use the shampoo, my hair change to silk. that's lie and exaxerate. but the company sold lots of them. 
 Second, if they tell only fact about a product on advertisements, no one will buy the product. If I were the advertisement maker, I will not tell only fact. In fact, many company try to show more better than to show more factly. It's of couse.
 Third, no one intervene hardly on their advertisement idea.many advertisements make products much better. But If one company  only express their product they really are, the company will don't succeed. they have to sell their product.  

Therefore, a purpose of advertising a product is to sell more. and many company try to show more better than to show more factly. and no one intervene hardly on their advertisement. It's free. so most advertisements make products looks better and want to show better than they really are.",
"The world of advertising is a carefully crafted landscape where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many employ persuasive techniques to make products seem far superior to their actual capabilities. This exaggeration, often achieved through selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals, is a common practice in the advertising industry. 

One of the most prevalent tactics is the selective presentation of information. Advertisements often highlight the positive features of a product while conveniently omitting any drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a weight loss product might showcase before-and-after photos of individuals who have achieved dramatic results, without disclosing the rigorous exercise routines and dietary restrictions that contributed to their success. This selective focus creates an illusion of effortless transformation, leading consumers to believe that the product alone is responsible for the desired outcome. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently appeal to emotions to create a sense of desire or urgency. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or fear, advertisers can manipulate consumers into believing that a product will fulfill their emotional needs. A perfume commercial, for example, might depict a woman feeling confident and attractive after using the product, implying that the perfume itself is the source of her newfound self-assurance. This emotional connection can overshadow the actual qualities of the product, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based on their feelings rather than rational considerations. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, it is undeniable that many employ deceptive tactics to make products appear more desirable than they truly are.

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a well-rounded education fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems from multiple perspectives. By studying diverse subjects, one develops a wider range of analytical tools and frameworks. For instance, a student with knowledge of history, economics, and psychology can approach a complex social issue with a more nuanced understanding than someone solely focused on one discipline. This ability to synthesize information from different fields is crucial in today's interconnected world. 

Secondly, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in the face of change. The job market is constantly evolving, and individuals with specialized skills may find themselves ill-equipped for new challenges. However, those with a broad knowledge base are more likely to adapt to changing circumstances and pursue new opportunities. For example, a person with a background in literature, philosophy, and computer science might be able to transition seamlessly into a career in data analysis or artificial intelligence. 

Finally, a broad education cultivates a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge. By studying different subjects, one begins to see how seemingly disparate fields are intertwined. For instance, understanding the principles of physics can shed light on the workings of the human body, while studying literature can provide insights into the complexities of human behavior. This holistic perspective allows individuals to see the world in a more comprehensive and meaningful way. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge, preparing individuals for a successful and fulfilling life in a rapidly changing world.",
"In my opinion is impossible to theoretically define whether it is better to manage several academic subjects or to go more in depth with just one subject. Indeed, it really depends on the field you will apply this academic knowledge to.

I think I'm in an ideal position to give some examples of different situations to which the two different approaches apply. So far, in fact, I had two very different working experiences, the first one as a Controller in a multinational company and the second (and current) one as a Management Consultant.

On the one hand, during my first work experience as a Controller I had to get a deep understanding of all the accounting principles that regulated the activities of the Finance department of my company. It was a really tough experience because I had to get familiar with a lot of very specific and technical subjects since otherwise the quality of my work might have been affected. I had to develop a very good memory to remember all the details typical of this kind of field.

On the other hand, during my current work experience as a Management Consultant I need to be more flexible than spcialized, so that now I'm  familiar with a huge variety of subjects. I work, in fact, in several different industries - such as automotive, consumer goods and banking - and in very different companies' functions - like for instance marketing, human resources and finance. Given that I usually work on very short projects, I always need to get familiar with the context of a project in a short period of time, which means that I need to have at least a generic background on that particular field. This usually allows me to work on the project without necessarly getting a very deep understanding of how the related inustry/functions works. 

To conclude, i would say that I generally prefer dealing with many different subjects rather than specializing myself. Nevertheless I think, as my working experience shows, that there always could be situations where you also need to get a specialistic knowledge.",
"I think that the statement is correct!
In our consumistic society an object's value is no more calculated by considering how much useful is or how good does its task!
Now for most of the goods have to be ''cool'' and have ''good looking''. 
In order to increase the ''coolines'' of an object the producer spend a great amount of money in advertising and promotions!
In example Apple computer pay a fee to major of the cinema in order to make machintosh computer appear in movies! If you pay attention in films you can quite only see mac! An other exemple [excuse me for speeking always about computers but I'm studing computer science engeneering... so I'm a sort of computer geek] again froma Apple is the ''look'' of macs... the apple's coputer lines have always an extremely cured design!
An other way to convice people of the ''cooliness'' of a product is to associate the product to famous people that are known being fashion!
''Fashion''... this is a key word! In our world in order to sell something you must get it become fashion!
Think about the iPod... it is the most popular mp3 readr of the world... and not for its technology; it is famous due to the fact its design is ''cool''! So now having an iPod maks you a ''coolo'' person!
For the people of the 21st century being ''cool'' and fashion is the most important thing [in particular for young people.. in fact for the beeing par of a group, and in particular the cool one, it what they aim for].
Counting on the fact that most of people in the civilized world watch a minimum of 2 howr of television a day... the best way to let products be known is through tv! Not only by spots... but also trough ''subliminal'' messagges! This consumistic society want to keep us slave of: ''be cool  or be nothing''!",
"I dont' agree on the following statement because it is essential for people to contribute to their societies through volunteer work and youths in general, tend to be very active and motivated to offfer their help at any time. Schools, universities, hospitals and many more present different tasks to encourage young people to help other people in their communities through volunteering. For example, a person could volunteer to teach young children a non-native language, or others could organize a charity for the needy in their neighbourhoods such as donating food, clothing, medicine and money especially during the Holy month of Ramadan. Helping the environment can result in educating students the importance of recylcing and maintaning a healthy atmosphere to live in. 
 We live in an age, where every person can be creative and can introduce new ways to strenghten the bonds between people and community work could do it, for instance the senior citizens need recreation so it is important for youths to find methods of entertaining them as part of their dedication to help the socieities where they live in. Students can also do their best to organize festivals and gatherings for children and the handicapped.   Everybody wants to be part of a community that appreciates hard work and the enthusiasm of young people ready to make a difference no matter where they live or how they think.",
"I  feel to have specialize in one specific subject because of various reasons.

Initally , as we are concentrating only on single specfic subject of our interst, it provides lot of scope to study in details of subject rather than, superflusilly.I feel that having little knowledge is always dangerous because, it may results in many problems .For ,example if i know a driving car  partially and i go for a ride then this may lead to accident. 

 Any student or professor who concentrates only on single subject produces very good results .For example if we consider  scientist  ""ALBERT EINSTEIN"" who concentrated only in physics and produced great equation (e=mc2) which is basis for famous princlple  ""THEORY OF  RELATIVITY"".which is used in all nuclear reactions, to measure the relative velocity between  to moving objects ...etc.

If we specalize in single subject we can understand concepts involved in subject in an effective way.Let us consider if i am specilazied in commincations  then there would be lot of scope to  get recruted  in communications company rather than, the person with  half knowledge in that subject.

Many universites ans colleges suppot to specilaze only in single subject  as they provide in their finall semisters or in post graduation
subjects of students interest i.e.., electives.This provides student to encourage in field of his /her own interest with out forcing to no each concepts.

so, I finally feels going for single subject is the best way to learn and understand as it provides scope for doing  researches in our interested fields of study.I feel that half knowledge is just like ""HALF CUP IS ALWAYS  EMPTY"" it  never gets filled up.As there are plenty of oppurtines  in specific fields  students should choose subject of their to excell in their academic and be a good citizen to country.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various initiatives. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change movements, such as Fridays for Future, showcases their dedication to environmental sustainability. These young activists organize protests, raise awareness, and advocate for policy changes, demonstrating their commitment to creating a better future for their communities. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to make a difference. Many young individuals are leveraging their technological expertise to develop innovative solutions for community challenges. For example, young programmers are creating apps that connect volunteers with local organizations, while social media influencers are using their platforms to raise funds for charitable causes. These examples highlight how young people are harnessing their abilities to contribute to their communities in meaningful ways. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people's lack of community involvement, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute. From volunteering their time to utilizing their skills, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact on their communities. By acknowledging their efforts and supporting their initiatives, we can foster a culture of civic engagement and empower them to continue making a difference.",
"I think I would agree with the statement that it's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Having vast knowledge in several kind of 
subjects allows you to have an opinion on such or such topic whereas if you specialize in only one area of study, you cannot form a rich opinion on any other area of study but your own. 

If you take the French academic system versus the American one. It clearly shows this difference. In France, when you enter university you have to choose a section, for example If I want to major in English, I won't be able to add psychology as a minor. So you have to specialize yourself quite early.Although this system tends to change, little by little, now with the ECTS system, which basically premits French students to go and study through Europe with the transfer of their credits and vice versa..

Whereas in the United States, each class is assigned to a specific number of credits, during your first two years of college you are able to choose within the large catalog of classes as long as you get a enough credits to validate your academic year. This means that you can take an anthropology as well as an algebra class. Thanks to this system, it enables you to get to know various subjects and to be able, later on, to choose in what realm of study you want to pursue your studies. In my opinion, this system is part of the reason why so many international students want to come and study in America. They want to see what each subject has to offer before specializing in one in particular.",
"i disagree with the statement "" its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific  subject"".i personally dont think that posession of broad knowledge in many subjects than specialisation in a single one.there is a small quote which supports this""jack of all traits is master in none"" and this is true.
	firstly the knowledge of subjects other than those wihich are useful to us are almost useless.""whats the use of knowledge of sewing clothes to an astronaut?"",the astronaut should study astronomical sciences,and other subjects related to it but not subjects which are no way related to it like sewing clothes.its not a problem to an astronaut that he cant sew.
	secondly in this world of unlimited knowledge its very tough to gather all the knowledge,even when you study hundreds of subjects there will always be an oceans proportion left over.there is a quote ""known is a drop unknown is an ocean.this accounts for those who are studying on a single subject also.there is much to learn for even those who specialize on a single subject,then its easy to imagine how knowledge should be gathered when you are studying many subjects.
	thirdly specialisation in a single subject helps in the advancement of the subject through research.specialising on one subject helps in perfong experiments on the latest topics in the subject which leads to the invention and discoveris of new theories,hypothesis etc.this helps in the over all development of the society.
	man since his birth developed to this stage only by specialising in single subject and developing it.as there are somany people on earth each one specializing on one subject will give overa",
"I srongly agree with the statement that  most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are because i think  in some cases this is the basic purpose of the advertisements .There are several examples to justify this statement. 
  Firstly take the example of Shampoos, now a days everybody has the problem of less hair and falling hair. In the market you can find a large number of shampoos that will help you in reducing the problem . In that case the advertisements will  gave you the idea of which shampoo you should buy. A well directed advertisement in which a girl is having less hair started using the product X regained  hair  by using it for say 14 days , this kind of advertisement will provoke you to buy the same product but the reality behind it may be different. Only after using it you will came across the actuality. The advertisements main aim is to attract more and more customers and it does not to give the real information all the times. Its the case  in most type of cosmetics too.
  Second take the example of  Yogurts, or any other food products, if you see any  thing in the advertisement then you will surely try to buy the same thing because you would be curious of know whether the product does the same as shown in the advertisement, but my personal experience suggests that the advertisements are the ostentacious  presentation in  case of most of the things. They are not  what they look in advertisements. 
  Finally i  believe that if you take the example of politicians you will find that in order to grab maximum votes they present themselves to be most promising among all others, nobody will show himself as a demagogue,So basically the purpose of advertisement is to make everything look perfect which could be far behind the reality.
  To sum up I can say that in most of the cases the real purpose of the advertisement is to make product looks good , beneficial and worth buying.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial, fostering adaptability, critical thinking, and a deeper understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's rapidly evolving world, careers and industries are constantly shifting. Individuals with a diverse range of knowledge are better equipped to navigate these changes, readily acquiring new skills and transitioning seamlessly between fields. For instance, a historian with a strong understanding of economics might find it easier to adapt to a career in data analysis, drawing upon their analytical skills and historical context. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking. By exposing oneself to diverse perspectives and disciplines, one develops the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify biases, and formulate well-rounded arguments. This critical thinking is essential for making informed decisions, solving complex problems, and engaging in meaningful discussions. For example, a student with a broad understanding of literature, history, and philosophy will be better equipped to analyze a complex social issue, considering its historical context, ethical implications, and literary representations. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base allows for a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of the world. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain a holistic perspective, recognizing how various disciplines influence and shape each other. This interconnectedness fosters a sense of wonder and appreciation for the complexity of the world, promoting empathy and understanding across different cultures and fields. For example, a scientist with a background in art history might be more likely to appreciate the beauty and artistry of scientific discoveries, fostering a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the world. 

In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of the world, equipping individuals with the skills and perspectives necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing world.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly across individuals. A young person might find immense joy in pursuing adrenaline-fueled activities, while an older person might derive greater satisfaction from quiet moments of reflection or spending time with loved ones.
For example, a teenager might find immense pleasure in attending a music festival, while a grandmother might find equal joy in tending to her garden and sharing stories with her grandchildren.
Secondly, life experiences shape our perspectives and influence our ability to appreciate the present. Older individuals have witnessed a wider range of events, both positive and negative, which can lead to a deeper understanding of life's complexities. This understanding can foster a sense of contentment and appreciation for the simple things, which may be overlooked by younger individuals.
For instance, a seasoned traveler might find more joy in a simple cup of coffee than a young person who is constantly seeking new and exciting experiences.
In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain energy and enthusiasm, it is unfair to claim they enjoy life more than older people. Enjoyment is a subjective experience that evolves throughout life, shaped by individual preferences, life experiences, and personal values.
Both young and old have the potential to find joy and fulfillment in their own unique ways, and it is important to recognize the diverse perspectives and experiences that contribute to our understanding of happiness.",
"Long has been written whether young people enjoy life more than older people do, as well as how old people enjoy life more than young people do. Nevertheless, I consider that enjoying life has more to do with people's attitude toward life than with them being young or old. Therefore, I will try to describe some ideas in order to support that enjoying life has much more to do with an attitude than with age.

For example, many people could think that enjoying life may be related to lifetime, therefore if you are young person you could enjoy life more than if you are old. Old people could think that  young people have much more energy, or more activities in a day and therefore they enjoy life much more than them. The only thing they don't stop to think is that usually young people don't have as much spare time as old people could have.
On the other side, many young people could possible think that old people enjoy life much more than them since they are retired and the could do whatever they want with their time.

As I have stated before, I definitely consider that enjoying life has more to do with waking up every morning feeling as if you need to do something, either walking, running, eating, sleeping, working, etc. and how you will manage to take the best part of the day. No matter if you are young or old, if you have lots of things to do every day or no, the only point is the attitude you put to live every day in order to be able to enjoy it.

Finally, I could say that enjoying life is not related to age since both being young or old you can enjoy life as much as you want.",
"A lot of Greek lyrical poets wrote odes to the beauty of youth, and elogiated it as the highest, most rewarding stage in life.  When the time came for them to deal with the old age, all their words assumed negative and dark implications, their rhythm slowed down, their optimism faded away, as if the wonderful joys that they had collected during their youth had completely disappeared, leaving no good memories, no sign at all.
	In my opinion, this is the best feature of the years that I am living: the great sense of expectation that I feel every day.  When you are young, everything seems easy to reach, possible.  It is as if you are given all the opportunities you want, and you can even dare to refuse some of them, to pick the ones you prefer.  And then, you are still at school.
	Studying definitely brings along a big amount of new, different and stimulating experiences that hit, strike and confuse the students with fantastic, oniric ideas of what the world could be.  This is the period in which they - we - inhalate the greatest part of images, sounds, colors and words, our own heritage for the rest of our life.  This is the time when our minds are completely open.
	On a more pragmatical side, youngsters' physical constitution allows them to do more activities than the elders can do.  Young people can run, dance, play every sport they want without having to worry for their backache or their ostheoporosis.  What is more, they can travel, see the world and all the beauty in it.  In his novel ""On The Road,"" Joseph Conrad writes that everyone who has the courage to wake up one day and leave to no definite destination is ""crazy, crazy of life.""  I do not think that there is a better way to say why youth is such an amazing, satisfacting and breath-taking period.  Maybe, as I said, the most important reason lies in the fact that young people can still dream.  And it is when you stop dreaming that your old age begins.",
"The statement about most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are.I agree about this point, I agree because this is from my experience in my life, when I saw some new product advertisement from the televioson, it always attract me, and I felt a urage from myself, I want to own that product.I want to bacome the same as they show it on the televison, but when I saw them from the shop or when I purcheased them, I found not very effective or same as they advertise. for example. the shampoo, we always see the model show their hair in the advertisements , it look like a falls. beautiful, shinning, but when you buy and use it, no doubt, toally different hair from the advertisemenrt, I think the same or similar examples are not difficult to find in your life.so most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are.so some people will say, it is fake, it destory the rights of customer,but this is a stratege of business.when they use some computer technique to change amd make much better than original product, it will encourage their product an oppertunity , people see their new product's advertisement and it appeal people,then thay will go to the shop , that is an oppertunity to let the people""feel "" their product and that can see what it is looks like , they can touch that product and thay will considear about thay willing to buy it or not.advertisement is not a directly way to show the quanty of that product is good or not. it just want make interested of people and appeal tham,and let them know that product, and give an oppertunity to touch and get close to their product. this is an stratege of busniess.",
"The assertion that young people today are not sufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize their own pursuits, there are countless examples of youth actively engaging in their communities and making a positive impact. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly participating in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-ups to food banks, they dedicate their time and energy to addressing local needs. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led climate activism demonstrates their commitment to creating a better future for their communities. These young activists organize protests, raise awareness, and advocate for sustainable practices, proving their dedication to making a difference. 

Secondly, many young people are using their skills and talents to improve their communities. They create educational programs, organize cultural events, and utilize technology to connect with others and promote social causes. The rise of online platforms and social media has empowered young people to amplify their voices and mobilize their peers to support local initiatives. These digital platforms allow them to reach a wider audience and encourage participation in community projects. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about an entire generation, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which young people contribute to their communities. Their commitment to volunteering, utilizing their skills, and leveraging technology for social good demonstrates their dedication to making a positive impact.
Therefore, it is unfair to claim that young people today are not giving enough time to helping their communities.",
"I would say that young people give or may not give enough time to help their communities. it depend upon individual mentality.
	If one wishes he can help but it depends on many factors like time,interest,responsibality and many more.if one wants to help he wil help without considering these factors cos he may love helping them.if one does not wants to help even if he has all those factors he wil not help.
	For example if ones sees his parent suffering from some pain he may not help.there may be many reasons for this also like not freindly atmosphere with his parent etc.
	Helping one needs courage because without it one is nothing in his life.so one needs this factor also.one might not help  because he might hav been had busy shedule like work and many more.
	 If one is busy even if he wishes he will not be abel to help one.helping communuties not requires young people but all the ages.nowadays some youngsters are become so busy spending their time in pubs, caffe days,eatouts they waste their tome spending in these places so where will they get the time for communuties.
	But some are not indluged in such activities so that they  get enough time to spend .so such people are very effectioned towards such communuties.
	But one is  more interested to get wealth so they far away places in such situations they might have enough time ot give their  communuties.even they may indulge in some friendship which avoids them to stay far away and not give enough time.
	Hence i conclude saying that it  depend upon individual mentallity to give enough time ot give their communuties.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers a profound understanding of a particular field, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This broader perspective fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and equips individuals with a more comprehensive understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base cultivates intellectual curiosity. When exposed to diverse subjects, individuals develop a thirst for learning and a desire to explore new ideas. This curiosity fuels their pursuit of knowledge beyond their chosen field, leading to a more holistic understanding of the world. For instance, a student with a broad knowledge of history, literature, and science can connect historical events to scientific advancements and literary interpretations, fostering a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge.
Furthermore, a broad education enhances critical thinking skills. By encountering different perspectives and methodologies across various disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information objectively, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This critical thinking is essential in navigating the complexities of modern society, where information is readily available but often unreliable.
Finally, a broad knowledge base provides a more comprehensive understanding of the world. By studying diverse subjects, individuals gain insights into different cultures, societies, and perspectives. This understanding fosters empathy, tolerance, and a greater appreciation for the complexities of human experience. For example, a student with knowledge of economics, sociology, and political science can better understand the factors that contribute to social inequality and develop informed solutions.
In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, individuals can become more well-rounded, adaptable, and equipped to navigate the challenges of the 21st century.",
"I don't agree with this statement because I think that having a deep knowledge in one specific subject is much better.

I think this because, even if a broad knowledge of many academic subjects could be important, in my opinion the world of our days require particular skills to the person. If a person had a knowledge of many subjects, he wouldn't be able to have a deep knowledge of every these subjects, and this could mean that he couldn't be able to solve determined problems which require a deep knowledge of a pattern. For example let us think about a manager who knows all the kinds of problems which could happen in an enterprise but who who hasn't a graet preparation in order to solve them because during his academic career he didn't specialized in one particular subject. In this case I think that even if this manager has a great preparation due to his enlarged studies, he wouldn't be able to give his contribute to the company. 

I also think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects automatically implies the fact that it can't be the result of a deep preparation in all these kinds of subjects. I think that this kind of knowledge could  be important to a person own satisfaction but if we assume that every subject could have been studied in deepth, it would have implied a lot of time spent (ten years or more) and I think that it wouldn'be of great importance becuse in my opinion the world requires our skills as soonest as we can! Beside I also think that the world  doesn't have the will to expect us completing our long studies in all the subjects, but it expects that we will able to provide it a quick solution its problems.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a simplistic and inaccurate view. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, such as pursuing new experiences and social connections, may not hold the same appeal for an older individual who prioritizes stability and meaningful relationships.
For example, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive greater happiness from spending time with their grandchildren.
Secondly, the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood can bring a different kind of fulfillment.
Older people often find satisfaction in their careers, families, and contributions to society.
They have the wisdom and experience to navigate life's complexities and appreciate the simple joys that younger people may overlook.
For instance, a seasoned professional might find immense satisfaction in mentoring younger colleagues and sharing their knowledge, while a young person might be focused on climbing the corporate ladder.
In conclusion, the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a flawed assumption.
Both stages of life offer unique opportunities for happiness and fulfillment.
While youth may possess a certain carefree spirit, older people have the benefit of experience, wisdom, and a deeper understanding of life's intricacies.
Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a personal journey that evolves with time and individual experiences.",
"To have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to learn many things in different fields of study. To specialize in one specific subject is to look at one thing from one point of view. In my opinion, it is better to have both of them as a part of your academical development, and they are both equally important.
	What truly happens in every person's academical development is that this person goes through different equally important stages. In the first stages of a childs life, this child learns how to speak, and then he or she learns how to write. This is general information that everyone should start with in the begining of their academic life.
	Then comes school, whatever, or wherever this person gets their education is all called school; Although, there are some  differences that occur on the level of that education. In school, people are taught all the essentials of life, and a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, including different sciences, mathematics, arts, music, and languages. These are the foundations each and every one of us need in our life. As the school education comes to an end, different people start to specialize in different subjects of their interests.
	Later on in life, we are approached by university; by we, i am reffering to the people who are looking at pursuing further education. University is where we are supposed to narrow our choices down, and choose specific fields of study. That is when it is proper for a person to specialize in one specific subject; in other words, major in something they are attracted to. In the end they are going to have to live with what they choose for the rest of their lives, and that is why they have to choose something they truly love.
	In conclusion, to have a broad knowledge on an academic subject, or to specialize in another are all equally important. You have to get a broad education first, and then narrow it down to what comforts you most. It is like, watching the rain fall, and then waiting for the rainbow to appear. From the first word a child learns at home to the last book this person reads, each and every stage in that persons life is important.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in community service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, they dedicate their time and energy to causes they believe in. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led climate change activism showcases their commitment to addressing global issues. These young individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices and platforms to raise awareness and advocate for change.

In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From traditional volunteer work to online activism, young people are actively engaged in making a difference. Their commitment to social responsibility and their innovative approaches to community service prove that they are not only shaping the future but also actively contributing to the present.",
"How many times did we buy a product after been delighted by its amazing beauty or features and then, we found out that it was really useless, with our great disappointment?
As a matter of fact advertising doesn't show the customer the downsides of its product or service, but emphasizes the essential advantages that it can bring into our lifes.
If we go deeper into the topic, analyzing how people develop commercials and advertisements, we can identify why this can happen.
First it's analyzed the ideal customer and, according to him/her tastes and preferences, some characteristics, or even emotions, are underlined in the advertisements.
Furthermore some tecnical devices are used to create the sensation of wealth in the consumer, for instance using the image of a creamy yoghurt, surrounded by fresh fruits and pieces of chocolate, even if, in the reality -practically making the commercials- the yoghurt is just a white-coloured cream, so creamy that it's impossible to recreate into reality.
In addition the advertisements can use the technique of the association to something else, even something that is completely different but that must share the same feeling of the advertized product. For example Gillette, a famous brand of razors, made an advertisement for its product placing, on a page of a magazine, the shape of the razor, close to a Ferrari,a sportif and expensive car.
The two shapes had the same bright colours in order to underline their hypothetical similarity regarding the strong sensations they could offer towards the consumer.
All this arguments are presented in order to emphasize some features that we feel, watching adverisements, and make products much better than they really are.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them seem far better than they actually are. This tendency is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to buy. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information and misleading claims. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might showcase a person who has achieved dramatic results, while conveniently omitting the fact that this individual may have also undergone rigorous exercise and dietary changes. Similarly, advertisements for beauty products often use heavily edited images and filters to create an unrealistic standard of beauty, leading consumers to believe that the product can deliver miraculous transformations. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and psychological manipulation to create a sense of urgency or desire. By associating products with positive emotions, such as happiness, success, or love, advertisers aim to evoke a subconscious connection between the product and these desirable feelings. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on fleeting emotions rather than rational considerations. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the vast majority employ various techniques to make products appear more appealing than they truly are. By selectively presenting information, using misleading claims, and appealing to emotions, advertisers aim to persuade consumers to buy, often at the expense of providing accurate and unbiased information. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"I agree with the statement. In Korea, all the highschool students work on only studying. Also their parents force to them study. As a result, all the students lose time to help their communities. They do not even help their family. Most of Korean lives in apartments. Once upon a time, everyone knew all the members in their town, and there was not someone who do not know in their town, because they always cared about their neighborhoods. However the apartment do not give any chance to meet their neighborhoods. One more, the jobs are getting more proffesional. Everyone engage in different part of jobs. So they do not have chance to think about their neighrhoods and communities. So the reasons i think are studying, apartment and proffesionalizing of jobs.
	First of all, the studying culture made students do not help their communities. In highschool, all the students compete eachother so badly, they do not have anytime to think their communities. They will have to go to academies after school, and they will be so tired. After the academies, they will fall asleep right after arriving at home. This culture make this society like that.
	Second, living in apartments is one of the reasons. Apartment is a seperated place. All the people do not care about their neighbors and do not know who are their neighrborhoods. The apartments are getting so big, and they will not remember who are the neighborshoods. Then no one will help each other, because they do not know each other. This is big problem of apartment. 
	Third, I think proffesionalizing of jobs is the biggest reason. Originally, people engaged on same work in Korea. Everyone growed crops. The agriculture was developed in Korea, so they always helped eachother. However, these days, everyone has different jobs. So they will help only people who are in their companies. Neighborhoods will not have any chance to meet each other. 
	Helping communities is really important to live this society. If we need help, no one will help us. We need to help each other and make good realationship with all the people in our communication and society.",
"I agree with the idea that youn people enjoy life more than older do. As one of the young people, I think it is true. I think enjoying life means enjoy doing things they like to do. In terms of it, younger people have advantages when it comes to enjoy things because of numbers of opportunities and physical ability. 
	First of all, young people have more oportunities and much time to do things. Since they are young, they have more years till their death if here we just think of average life span. They can do whatever they want to try and they can try it again if they like it and never have to do it if they hate it. Older people need to think about what they can do during rest of their life and it might discourage them to do everything they want to do. Knowing that they have limited time left to enjoy, older people might be too nervous to try things. Young people do not care about it, so they can enjoy things more.
	Second of all, whenever someone does something, he needs to think about his physical ability. For older people, they tend to have more physical problems and deseases than younger people do. For example, my grandparents love to travel around the world but they cannot do that anymore in these days because of their body problems. It is very easy for them to be tired and stressed out by going somewhere by planes and by staying hotels in countries they do not understand languages. Also, it is hard to recover from that. In contrast, younger people have stronger body and physical ability that can get over such tire and stress. They can do their favorite things more often than older people do.
	In conclusion, I believe that young people make their life more enjoynable than older people do. They have longer time to do things and stronger physical conditions to try things they like than older do. Such unchangenable situations make me sure that young people enjoy.",

In that competition those students and persons can win whose knowledge is broad. If you will win the competition then also it is a better achievement for the school that a student has won the madel , but you will also appreciated  for your broad knowledge , people also give the respect to you.

"Today, the new generation is not as sensitive as their parents. They hid after their childhood and escape from the responsibilities. I agree for the statement. Young people do not give time to help to other people. I guess this situation comes because of only one thing. ""Technology Improvement"".

Technology refers so many areas. Television, advertisements, music, i-pods, games and of course computers and chatting. Young people prefer watching TV or playing a computer game to giving time to help their communities. They all friends do this as well. They spend so much time at their rooms and do not talk to theis parents as well. In school theis conversations with their friends are not about the community. In spite of the problems they share only the games and their online communications skills. Internet is now widespread. It makes the distance closer. The young people find friends from other countries. They improve their foreign languages and they learnt the culture of the countries. They like chatting to unknown friends. On my opinion, the young people are not guilty but their parents. 

Parents should be a leader for their children. They can coordinate and organize the times to play, to study or to meet the helpless people. Sensitivity begins in childhood. Sensitivity is teached only by parents; not by teachers or friends. They can learn their children that the life consists of not only the music, friends,TV or chatting but also people, trees, ecology, and the world they can't imagine. 

Technology is a great strength and opportinity but its necessary to learn how to use it. Be sensitive and be awere of the community. Spend time for them.",

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often highlight only the positive aspects of a product, while downplaying or completely omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals achieving dramatic results, without mentioning the possible side effects or the need for lifestyle changes. By focusing solely on the desired outcome, the advertisement creates an unrealistic expectation that the product will deliver miraculous results. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. They use powerful imagery, music, and storytelling to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or desire. For example, a car commercial might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that owning the car will bring them joy and adventure. However, the reality is that the car itself does not guarantee happiness or fulfillment. 

In addition to selective information and emotional appeals, advertisers often employ misleading visuals to enhance the appeal of their products. They use professional photography and editing techniques to create images that are unrealistic and unattainable. For instance, a beauty product advertisement might showcase a model with flawless skin, while in reality, the product may only provide minimal improvement. These exaggerated visuals create a false sense of perfection and can lead consumers to feel disappointed when they purchase the product. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately portray products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits and qualities. By selectively presenting information, appealing to emotions, and using misleading visuals, advertisers create an idealized version of reality that can mislead consumers. It is important for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young individuals contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.


Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, they dedicate their time and energy to causes they believe in. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led climate change activism showcases their commitment to addressing pressing social issues. These young individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices to advocate for change. 

Secondly, the rise of social media has provided a platform for young people to connect with their communities and mobilize for social causes. Online platforms allow them to organize events, raise awareness, and contribute to fundraising efforts. The recent Black Lives Matter protests, largely organized through social media, are a testament to the power of young people to drive social change. 

In conclusion, while there may be some young people who prioritize personal interests over community involvement, it is unfair to generalize about an entire generation. Young people are actively engaged in their communities, contributing their time, skills, and voices to address social issues and create positive change. Their dedication to making a difference is evident in their participation in volunteer organizations, online activism, and various other forms of community engagement.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a generalization that fails to account for the multifaceted nature of happiness and the diverse experiences of individuals across different age groups. While youth may possess certain advantages, such as boundless energy and a sense of limitless possibilities, claiming that they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a simplistic and inaccurate statement.
Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, like pursuing new experiences or engaging in adventurous activities, may not hold the same appeal for an older individual who values stability, comfort, and meaningful relationships. For instance, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive more pleasure from spending time with their family or pursuing hobbies they have cultivated over years.
Secondly, older people often have a deeper understanding of life's complexities and have learned to appreciate the small joys that may be overlooked by younger generations. They have weathered storms and emerged stronger, developing resilience and a sense of perspective that allows them to find contentment in the everyday. Moreover, they have accumulated wisdom and experience that can bring a sense of fulfillment and purpose.
In conclusion, while youth may have certain advantages, it is unfair and inaccurate to claim that they enjoy life more than older people. Happiness is a multifaceted concept that is influenced by a multitude of factors, and individuals of all ages can find joy and fulfillment in different ways. It is important to recognize the unique experiences and perspectives of each generation and to appreciate the diverse ways in which people find happiness throughout their lives.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain carefree energy and a sense of boundless possibilities, equating this to a greater enjoyment of life is a simplification. Both young and old experience a unique spectrum of joys and challenges, making it impossible to definitively declare one age group as inherently happier. 

Firstly, young people often face a different set of pressures than older individuals. The pursuit of education, career aspirations, and financial stability can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety. While they may have the freedom to explore new experiences, this freedom can also be daunting, especially in a world that often feels uncertain and competitive. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a greater sense of stability and security, allowing them to focus on personal fulfillment and leisure activities. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves with time. What brings joy to a young person may not hold the same appeal for an older individual. For instance, a young person might find immense satisfaction in attending a concert or traveling to a new country, while an older person may derive more pleasure from spending time with family, pursuing hobbies, or simply enjoying the quiet moments of reflection. 

Finally, it's important to acknowledge that life experiences shape our perspectives. Older individuals have witnessed a wider range of events, both positive and negative, which contribute to their understanding of life's complexities. This wisdom, coupled with a greater appreciation for the present moment, can lead to a deeper sense of contentment and fulfillment. 

In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain vibrancy and enthusiasm, it is inaccurate to claim that they enjoy life more than older people. Both age groups experience life's joys and challenges in unique ways, and the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout our lives. Ultimately, happiness and fulfillment are not confined to any particular age group, but rather a product of individual experiences, perspectives, and choices.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and amplifying their impact. For example, the recent surge in online activism surrounding environmental issues demonstrates the power of young people to drive change through digital platforms. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work and community organizations. From volunteering at local soup kitchens and animal shelters to participating in environmental clean-up projects, they are actively contributing to the well-being of their communities. Many schools and universities also encourage community service, providing opportunities for students to gain valuable experience and make a difference. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community service takes many forms. Young people may not always be engaged in traditional volunteer activities, but they are contributing to their communities in other ways. For instance, they may be involved in local arts and cultural events, supporting small businesses, or simply being good neighbors. These seemingly small acts of kindness and support can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of a community. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people's involvement in community service, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, young people are actively engaged in making a difference in their communities. By recognizing and celebrating their efforts, we can foster a culture of civic engagement and empower them to continue making a positive impact on the world.",
"Nowedays, competition between companies is feirce, every one needs  do his best in order to sell his product and survive in the market. and advertisements is a very efficient technique to sell  and be successeful.
    I totally agree that most advertisement make the product look much better than they really are, everything look so wonderful on TV or on a magazine. new technologies are applied to make people and celebities so perfect, bottles of product look bigger and to easy to use and to open.....
    As a result, advertissements are having a big and negative influence on people's life, it is just and endless process of a ""must have"". We always find things that we don't really need, but we buy it anyway just because we saw it on TV last night !  and we end up bu spending hundreds of dollars because we thought it was somthing that we can't live without.
    aAother negative thing that influence adults as well as teenagers is using celebrities to promote a certain product. everyone become obseste and has to have this product. for instance, product for  wrinkles or acne. just because it worked for a calabrity doesn't mean that it would work for you, everyone's skin and hair is different. another example is the clothes. most of celebrities and models are thin and tall, and everyone has a different body shape, so, if those clothes look good on the model it doesn't mean that they would fit you. and the worst thing of all in teenagers watching those commecials, they can starve themselve or be anorexique in order to look like something irealistice, those photos  shown in magazine are fake most of the time, they can make you look taller or thiner.
     In conclusion, I beleive that advertisements are not real most of the time, and the producers exagerate and make things look so much better than what they really are, but companies that never keep their promesses will cost them a lot because they will lose the costumer's trust and will have a bad reputation. advertisement can be efficient and work for the compagnie and make it popular and efficient  if the things shown are real and not just lies and exagerations.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and a sense of endless possibilities, the reality is that both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life.


Firstly, young people often face significant pressures that can detract from their enjoyment. The academic demands of school, the pressure to succeed in their careers, and the constant need to impress their peers can create a sense of stress and anxiety. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a level of stability and financial security that allows them to focus on their passions and interests. They may have more time to travel, pursue hobbies, and spend time with loved ones, leading to a greater sense of fulfillment. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves with age. Young people may find excitement in adrenaline-pumping activities like extreme sports or social gatherings, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from quiet moments of reflection, spending time in nature, or engaging in meaningful conversations.
For example, a young person might find joy in attending a concert with friends, while an older person might find equal satisfaction in reading a good book in a peaceful garden. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with a certain carefree spirit, it is inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. Both age groups experience unique joys and challenges, and the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life.

"Times change quickly...very quickly indeed. A few years ago, the computers were reserved for the army, Internet was unknown. One may ask, 'what is the point of having a broad knowledge if it will soon become outdated and useless? Isn't it better to specialize in one subject and try to keep in touch with its evolution?' I will try to answer this question to the light of my own education and beliefs. 

I believe that acquiring a broad knowledge is very important for people. Subjects are all linked together and the understanding of one can lead to the discovery of another. Have you ever tried to learn how to play music without knowing about the notes? Learning about geopolitics without knowing about history is the same. There is no clear division between subjects. Some are necessary to learn about others.

Another reason is the importance of learning. What we learn is not that much important. The way we learn it, however, is important. We learn how to learn. And that is achieved through learning about a lot of subjects. This way, people will know how to learn all their life long, even when they will be out of school. Knowing a lot helps learning better. 

The main argument against this theory is that people, who know a lot about many facts, know indeed little. It is difficult to counterpart this argument. One who is interested in many subjects, will never reach the same level of awareness and mastering than the one who has only studied this very subject. 

However, I would like to point out that this person will have troubles putting what he has learned into perspective, while the one who has a broad knowledge of things will be able to connect facts. 

Learning a lot about many academics subjects may prepare people to understand the convergence of the world. Global has become a masterword today...one that noone can escape. One can only prepare himself for it...by learning as much as possible for instance.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's horizons is a constant debate. While specializing in a specific subject offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic disciplines is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters a more holistic understanding of the world and equips individuals with the adaptability and critical thinking skills necessary to navigate complex challenges.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows for a more comprehensive understanding of interconnected issues. For example, a historian studying the rise of the Roman Empire might benefit from understanding the economic and social factors that contributed to its success, which could be gleaned from studying economics and sociology. This interdisciplinary approach provides a richer and more nuanced perspective on complex phenomena.
Secondly, a broad education fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By encountering diverse perspectives and methodologies from different disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify biases, and formulate well-rounded solutions. This adaptability is crucial in today's rapidly changing world, where problems often require interdisciplinary solutions.
Finally, a broad knowledge base enhances communication and collaboration. Individuals with diverse knowledge can effectively communicate with experts from different fields, fostering interdisciplinary research and innovation. This collaborative approach is essential for tackling global challenges such as climate change and poverty, which require the combined expertise of scientists, economists, and policymakers.
In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base provides a more holistic understanding of the world, fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and enhances communication and collaboration. Therefore, I believe that it is more beneficial to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",
"The ubiquitous nature of advertising in our modern world makes it difficult to escape its influence. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of their offerings, creating an idealized image that often falls short of reality. This tendency to embellish is driven by the desire to attract consumers and generate sales, often at the expense of honest representation. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For example, a commercial for a weight-loss supplement might showcase a slim and toned individual, implying that using the product will guarantee similar results. However, it fails to mention the potential side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise, which are crucial for achieving sustainable weight loss. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and persuasive language to create a sense of urgency or desirability. They may use catchy slogans, celebrity endorsements, or heartwarming stories to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. These emotional triggers can cloud consumers' judgment and lead them to make impulsive purchases based on unrealistic expectations. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority tend to present an overly optimistic and often misleading portrayal of products. By selectively highlighting positive attributes and employing emotional manipulation, advertisers create a false sense of perfection that rarely aligns with the actual experience of using the product. Consumers must be aware of these tactics and approach advertising with a critical eye, relying on independent research and personal experience to make informed decisions.",
"Sometimes the economic business doesn t tell the true,in particular with advertisements.Every day I can see a lot of products that the enterprises describe us very good,but when you buy those you can have a bad products.
I complitely agree with that statement and for me the best exampl is with the food advertisement.When you can see that kind of advertisement it seem to be the best food,very delicious and attractive,and you are involved to buy this food,but when you eat this, it is very bad.I think it with the example of the food, because you can t taste,and only if you try you will know if the food is good or no,you can not make the same statement with clothes or tecnological things because you can see those on the advertisement and when you will go to the shops you can read,see,touch and ask informations.
I mean also with these kinds of products happened to buy bad things.
So I think that the enterprises take advantages under this profile,but if I see the situation under their view I can understand them because they need to sell the product and they have to involve people to buy their product.
Actually I think that this way to sell the product is wrong not only because the enterprise sell a bad thing to the public but it will lost a clients in the future,because the consumer will not buy other thing of that brand.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. However, the statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" is a generalization that requires careful consideration. While it is true that many advertisements employ persuasive techniques to enhance the appeal of products, it is not accurate to claim that all or even most advertisements engage in blatant misrepresentation. 

One reason why this statement is not entirely accurate is that there are regulations in place that prevent companies from making false or misleading claims in their advertisements. For example, in many countries, advertising agencies are required to provide evidence to support any claims they make about the effectiveness or benefits of a product. This means that while advertisements may use creative language and imagery to highlight the positive aspects of a product, they are generally bound by legal constraints that prevent them from making outright lies. 

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that consumers are not passive recipients of advertising messages. They are capable of critically evaluating the information presented in advertisements and making informed decisions based on their own needs and preferences. Consumers are often aware of the persuasive techniques used in advertising and can distinguish between genuine product benefits and exaggerated claims. For instance, a savvy consumer might be skeptical of an advertisement that promises miraculous weight loss results without any scientific evidence to support its claims. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may exaggerate the benefits of products, it is inaccurate to claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Consumers are capable of discerning the truth from hyperbole, and regulations help to ensure that advertising remains within ethical and legal boundaries. Therefore, it is essential to approach advertising with a critical eye and to rely on a combination of information sources when making purchasing decisions.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local clean-up drives to advocating for environmental sustainability, young people are taking the lead in addressing pressing issues. The recent surge in climate activism, with young people spearheading protests and demanding action from governments, is a testament to their commitment to making a difference.

Furthermore, many young people dedicate their time to volunteering at local organizations. They contribute to food banks, shelters, and hospitals, providing essential support to those in need. This dedication reflects a genuine desire to give back and improve the lives of others.

While it's easy to focus on the perceived apathy of some, it's crucial to recognize the vast number of young people who are actively engaged in their communities. Their efforts, whether through organized initiatives, volunteering, or simply lending a helping hand, demonstrate a strong sense of social responsibility and a desire to create a better world. Therefore, the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is an oversimplification that fails to capture the full picture.",
"Advertissement is represented everywhere. Every year, millions of new products born across the world. Communication agencies develop better campaign that in the past. A product is not anymore a  good or service. It becomes the identity of a compagny or a specified target. The competition getting harder, the creators and infographistes use manipulation technics to sell the image of the product. 

Firstly, everyday life products are more and more difficult to promote. Every theme has been used in the past. Agencies has to give a new identity to the product. For example, Saatchi Saatchi, one of biggest European communication agency has developed a campaign based on erotism and exotism to sell a car. The performance of the new motor or the shape of the car where not the main informations to communication. In order to sell the model, the agency has created a dream situation which will transfer the customer into a  harem of wonderful feminin creatures swearing only abouth this car.

Secondly, the industrial market is overcrowded. Compagnies are developing new products which are already in the market due to their competitors. For instance, the role of the advertissement will be to give an idea than the new product of Coca Cola is better than the one of Pepsi. The two products are similar in a way but differ by their name and image. On one hand, Coca Cola will be represented by young and dynamic persons singing in the street, breaking the rules. On the other hand, Pepsi advertisement will show drawings. The two advertissement campaigns will make the products seem much better than they really are. 

To sum up, the main role of advertisement is to sell goods and service. Whatever the real capacity or necessity of the product, the advertisement will present a product more colorful, more useful and promess to the target that it will change its life.",
"There is no denying that the question of which people enjoy life more has become controversial. Not only for professionals, but also for public as a whole. Someone says that young people enjoy life more, while others dispute it. As for me, my personal opinion sides with the former. Among countless factors with influence my choose, there are three conspicuous listed as follow.

First of all, it is easily observe in modern society there are a lot of entertainment. There are televsions, computers, radios, TV games and so on. There were many many different entertainment for the people to enjoy for their life. Besides this, they can also play different kind of sports. It is not strange to find out that no people will feel boring in the society. They have more things to do for enjoy them life than the older people as the various of inventions to suit with their life.

Apart from this, people nowadays are more concerned about enjoyment than the older people. If the young people have a long hoildays, they may travel to visit different countries. If they have enough money, they may like to enjoy a big meal or shopping. All of these are different kind of ways for enjoying life.

However, the old people also have their own ways to enjoy life. they would like to play chess with other. Or feeding pets such as birds, goldfish, dogs, etc. This is their ways for enjoying life. As for me, I would prefer to enjoy my life on the hi-technology things like televsion, computers. That is why I thing that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

In conclusion, if we add up all the ways of enjoying life. We may easily to find out  that young people have much more ways for enjoying the life than the older people do. Thus, I am totally agree with the statement.",
"Everyone in this world can enjoy his life in his own ways. people are different in expressing thier enjoying of life. How we can ejoy this life and be happy? Everyone knows that life is not easy and it needs lots of work to be successful person in it. There are two groups of people who can enjoy this life such as, The young people and the older pepole.

     First, yong peple can ejoy life in different ways. For example, they can do many things in this life without any responsibility for what they are doing because they know that the resposibility are carried for thier parents. Also, they can do a lot of things that the older people can't do as a result of health. Young people can do a lot of activities on one day , but the older peolpe can't do that. So the young people are the right people to enjoy this life.
     
    Secound, older poeple can,t enjoy this life like the young people.
There are different reasons for that. The firt reason, is that the are responsible for eveything they do.  Also, the reason of health can't help them to do a lot of activities on one day. The logic provides these points in a very clear way. Old people had already taken their time to enjoy this life when they were young. So they have to give the chance for the other generation to enjoy his own life.
    
     Finally, in my opinion, i agree that young people are the right peolpe to enjoy tis life.That is because the older people had already taken thier own chance. Also, i disagree that the older peolple must relax after they have finished thier work in the whole life because they are the people who must have other works. Such as,  teaching thier children the right tings to do and to have the resposibiltiy of what thier young children do.

     In conclusion, this life is for all the peolpe to enjoy, but the right people or the people who have the chance to enjoy it more are the young people. We must all enjoy this life in the duration of time when we are young.",

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Exposure to diverse subjects allows individuals to connect ideas across disciplines, leading to innovative solutions. For instance, a historian studying the Roman Empire might draw parallels to modern political systems, while a scientist understanding the principles of physics could apply them to engineering challenges. This interdisciplinary approach enhances creativity and adaptability in a rapidly changing world. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base promotes intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. When individuals are exposed to a variety of subjects, they are more likely to discover their passions and pursue them with enthusiasm. This intrinsic motivation fuels further exploration and personal growth, enriching their lives and contributing to society. For example, a student who enjoys both literature and science might become a science writer, bridging the gap between complex scientific concepts and the general public. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more holistic and enriching approach to learning. It fosters critical thinking, promotes intellectual curiosity, and ultimately leads to a more well-rounded and adaptable individual. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, we can unlock our full potential and contribute meaningfully to the world around us.",
"I agree it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for many and different reasons.
In the first i have many possibilities to speak with the other persons because the knowledge many subjects will do of me an intresting person. Moreover to study many subjects permits to me to know different persons and different things. This is very important for my future because i have many possibilities for my life, for my job, for my hobbies, etc. 
For my job, for example, to know different subjects is very important because ti is an intellectual job and if i will specialize in one specific subject i will not become a good architect. To specialize in one specific subject means that i am a limited person.
The knowledge of many subjects is the most important thing for the growth of an individual, the intelletual's growth, because a person can to become a bad person, while he is an intelligent person he will hasn't the difficult with the social relationship. 
To understand my topic i have an example: my father started to work when he was a child, but when he became a man for his culture and to create the future he started to study and now he is a manager of heating sistem.
Now the younger have many possibilities for to study immediately with the school, with numerous books, with the TV and with the newspapers and therefore because it don't do it.
In the end, it is very bored to study only one subject because the time don't never walk!",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, the social pressures of fitting in and navigating complex relationships can contribute to stress and uncertainty. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find excitement in new experiences and adventures, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from the comfort of routine and the wisdom gained through years of experience. For example, a young person might find joy in traveling to a new country, while an older person might find contentment in spending time with their grandchildren. 

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that happiness is not a constant state. Both young and old individuals experience periods of joy and sorrow, and their ability to enjoy life is influenced by a multitude of factors, including personal circumstances, health, and relationships.

"In our society, one of the most important activity is consumtion. this activity is a war between different brands in order to attract  the consumer.  to attract consumers,  brands use advertisement, and most of the time the products appear better than they really are for different reasons.


 Certain brands more specially in  sport  buisnes , use celebrity to sale their product s.  when we watch these commercials we think that these shoes or tennis racket are going to improve our running or tennis abilities, but most of the time they are the same that the ones we have with a better design .



Other brands use visual effects to show how incredibles their products are  specially in the car industry . cars are filmed in special environements wich impress you and keep your focus out of the automobile. the perfumme industry also makes you beleive that if a man wears a special perfumme he is going to be popular with girls wich is also false.



In the cleaning industry a lot of brands say that their products are the best , and that they will clean everything  from mud to ketchup ; altough in practise most of the time the products do not  clean like in the commercials . 



 Companies don't have the choice wether or not to make realitic advertisement becausw there is so much competition between the brands that otherwise their sales will suffer. the governement should be the one regulating this problem.",
"I totally agree with this statement.It's an interesting question because there are a huge number of different  opinions about this subject,it's an actual debate between young and old people.I think that young people enjoy life more than old people because of three reasons.

First, the most important thing is that young people are in a better health than old people.Thus, they are able to do a lot of activities,in a lot of domaines.They can for example do extreme and risky sports like motobikering,snowboard in mountains or jumping from a plane!
In addition they can go for long trips,specially to do bivouacs or others types of trips wich demands to be in a good physical condition.It's a big inconvenient for old people because they don't have the same capacities.
The second reason is that young people demonstrate more interest to some aspects of life,specially the different ways to have fun.Young people are always looking for a way to enjoy all what they do like activities,sports or simply studies.They have also the chance to have  a lot of time in front of them,I mean the future.So they can make projects for their life about all the aspects of a life.They can do studies and change definitely to do other types of studies.It's more difficult for older people because they don't have the chance to could change the orientation and the type of their life because they have a lot of engagements ans responsabilities.
Finally, young people  enjoy life more because they have the oportunity to discover the world for the first time,by doing mistakes for example.Consequently they can enjoy a lot of experiences by studying,traveling in different ways and specially meet people around the world.This example is significative specially in affective relation ships because they are not yet engaged in a mariage,so they can enjoy their time with a lot of different relationships to discover the right person they want to be with.
To summarize,young people enjoy life more than old people because they have all the time to live new experiences and feel new sent",
"Nowadays, many students are studying many academic fields and at the same time, it is a problem wether they must have broad knowledge or specialized knowledge.I agree with the idea that it is better to have broad kowledge of many academic fields.There are two reasons for this.
     First of all, broad knowledge is base of all academic skills. For example, in my university, I must have taken many fields of lectures in my first grade. Afterwards, I study a specific subject, communication. Because I learned many academic fields, I study my major more effectively. Moreover, knowing many academic fields can be useful in many ways. For instance, when a doctor makes up his mind to start his job as a doctor, it is important where to build the hospital, what ages of consumers in each areas, and so on. That is the time when business management or psycology are useful.
     Secondly, common sense is needed for living in society. For example, I live in Japan and especially in Japan, companies strongly hope new workers to have common sense because Japanese are having less and less common sense these days.    
     For these reasons, I agree with that having broader academic knowledge is better. I think broden knowlwdge of many academic fields is base of our studying and lead to have common sense.",
"The assertion that young people today neglect their communities is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various initiatives. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work. Organizations like Habitat for Humanity and local food banks rely heavily on the energy and enthusiasm of young volunteers. These individuals dedicate their free time to building homes, serving meals, and supporting vulnerable populations. Their efforts directly impact the well-being of their communities, showcasing their willingness to give back. 

Furthermore, young people are at the forefront of social activism. They mobilize online and offline to raise awareness about pressing issues such as climate change, social justice, and mental health. Through protests, petitions, and online campaigns, they advocate for positive change and inspire others to take action. Their passion and commitment to creating a better world demonstrate their deep connection to their communities. 

Finally, young people are actively involved in entrepreneurial ventures that benefit their communities. They establish businesses that provide jobs, support local economies, and address social needs. From sustainable food initiatives to innovative technology solutions, these young entrepreneurs are creating positive change through their ingenuity and dedication. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to focus on the perceived apathy of some young people, it's crucial to recognize the vast number who actively contribute to their communities. From volunteering to activism to entrepreneurship, young people are demonstrating their commitment to making a difference. Their efforts are a testament to their dedication to building a better future for themselves and their communities.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, I strongly agree that most tend to exaggerate their qualities, making them seem far superior to what they truly are. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the desire to entice consumers and generate sales. 

One glaring example of this phenomenon is the ubiquitous use of photo editing software in beauty and fashion advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve unrealistic proportions and flawless skin, creating an unattainable standard of beauty. This manipulation can lead consumers to feel inadequate and dissatisfied with their own appearance, ultimately driving them to purchase products that promise to achieve the impossible. 

Furthermore, advertisements often employ persuasive language and emotional appeals to create a sense of urgency or desirability. They may highlight trivial features or exaggerate the benefits of a product, making it seem like a necessity rather than a luxury. For instance, a commercial for a new cleaning product might claim it can eliminate all germs and leave your home sparkling clean, even though it may only be slightly more effective than other products on the market. 

In conclusion, while advertising plays a crucial role in informing consumers about available products, it often goes beyond simply presenting facts. The majority of advertisements rely on exaggeration, manipulation, and emotional appeals to create a distorted perception of reality. This practice can be detrimental to consumers, leading them to make uninformed decisions and potentially feel disappointed with their purchases. It is essential to remain critical and discerning when evaluating advertising messages, recognizing that they are often designed to sell a product rather than provide an objective assessment of its true value.",
"It has been a controversial issue whether some people think to specialize in one specific subject is more effctive on developmence of student. However i strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects than to specilize in one specific subject.
 
       first and foremost,  it is easy to fine my interesting subject.
taking a various subject mean is improve their kowledge skill and i can find my major during the study. in my case, in elementsry school, i learnd about math english, arts, music, but after, exam i thought i lterested in music and arts.
when i was a little child , i spent whole day drawing a picture. i did not know why i spent a lot of time even do not eating. after graduated from middle school i went Arts high school and also i graduated from Arts university. that is becaue i could found which subject  like it and what i boring the subject.



       Last but not least, it helps development of knowledge.
if student study one specific subject during the childhood.
it result in lack of knowledge and they do not know varioud filed.
such as my friend brother, Jun Kim, he was very smart in English when he was 5years old. so their patrent decided to study abroad .
after 5years , when he was in Korea he can not speak Korean.
it result in he just can speak English Fluently. althought he is Korean.

       In conclusion, i think that to have broad kowledge of many academic subject is",
"I strongly agree that the young people nowdays donot give enough time to their  communities.Young people who are generally considered as the major force, the future of the any nation ironically dont spend much of the time helping the communities . They generally donot raise voices against the injustic , against the activities carried by the malicious minds present in our society .

Firstly  the young people of nowdays are gererally to obessesed by self-needs that they donot tend to think of the society . The term too-selfcentered is the best to describe the young generation of the era.The need of  money , the self problems  like emotional ones tends to isolate  the young  people form the community as a whole for example the software graduate are willing to work for long hours in order to earn more money .The greed for money could be for family or for themselves whatever might be the reason he is deprived of his valuable time.The  problem can only be solved by the satisfaction in less money not by  abudence of it .The solution to the emotional problem is that young peolpe should involve in the family more for the emotional support The more spare time they  have the more the involvement is there form the part of the youngesters.

The second most important reason is the laws ,procedure and policies of the government are as such as the young people tend to think twice before helping and trying to raise the voices in favor of their communities.For example  if their is problem regarding the demolishing of the houses of their communities if the young people want to raise their voices they might end up in the jail. This is the result of the flaws of the laws and policies of the government. The solution to the problem is the laws and policies should be such that young people are not scared against helping their community.

The less greed  for money accompanied with the work-satisfaction & the laws and policies which are not harsh will generally encourage the young peole nowdays to help the communities .",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth often possesses a certain carefree spirit and a sense of boundless possibility, equating this with a higher level of enjoyment is a simplification. Both young and old individuals experience life's joys and sorrows, and their capacity for happiness is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond age. 

Firstly, young people may experience a greater sense of freedom and adventure, as they are often less burdened by responsibilities. They may have fewer financial constraints, allowing them to pursue spontaneous activities and travel. However, this freedom can also be a double-edged sword, leading to uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Older individuals, on the other hand, may have a more stable and secure life, but they may also feel limited by their commitments and routines. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find joy in the thrill of new experiences, while older individuals may find fulfillment in the satisfaction of achieving their goals and nurturing relationships. For example, a young person might find immense joy in attending a music festival, while an older person might find equal joy in spending time with their grandchildren. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not solely determined by age. It is a complex interplay of personal circumstances, values, and perspectives. While youth may possess a certain exuberance, older individuals often possess wisdom and a deeper appreciation for life's simple pleasures. Both stages of life offer unique opportunities for happiness and fulfillment, and it is unfair to suggest that one group enjoys life more than the other.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a well-rounded education fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge.


Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems from multiple perspectives. By understanding concepts from different disciplines, one can analyze situations more comprehensively and identify solutions that might not be apparent to someone with a narrow focus. For example, a historian with knowledge of economics might be better equipped to understand the causes of a historical conflict than someone solely focused on historical events. 

Moreover, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, skills like problem-solving, communication, and creativity are highly valued. Individuals with a broad knowledge base are more likely to possess these skills, as they have been exposed to diverse ideas and ways of thinking. They are also better equipped to adapt to new challenges and opportunities, as they can draw upon a wider range of knowledge and experience. 

Finally, a broad education promotes a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. By studying different subjects, individuals can see how ideas and concepts from one field influence another. This holistic perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of the world and its complexities. For instance, studying both literature and history can provide insights into the social and cultural context of literary works, enriching the reading experience. 

In conclusion, while specialization is valuable in certain fields, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge, preparing individuals for a successful and fulfilling life in a complex and ever-changing world.",
"The world of advertising is a vast and persuasive landscape, filled with images and messages designed to entice consumers. While some advertisements may accurately reflect the qualities of a product, it is undeniable that many others employ techniques to make products seem far more appealing than they truly are. This exaggeration, often achieved through selective presentation and emotional appeals, can mislead consumers and create unrealistic expectations. 

One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often focus on the most positive aspects of a product, highlighting its benefits while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new weight loss product might feature a slim and energetic individual, while conveniently neglecting to mention the potential side effects or the need for a healthy lifestyle. This selective focus creates a distorted image of the product, making it appear more effective than it actually is. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. They use catchy slogans, heartwarming stories, and aspirational imagery to evoke feelings of happiness, success, or belonging. By tapping into these emotions, advertisers can create a sense of desire and urgency, convincing consumers that they need a particular product to achieve a certain feeling or lifestyle. For example, a perfume advertisement might depict a glamorous woman surrounded by admirers, suggesting that using the perfume will make the consumer equally desirable. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the product's actual qualities and lead consumers to make purchases based on unrealistic expectations. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, it is undeniable that many others employ techniques to make products seem much better than they really are. By selectively presenting information and appealing to emotions, advertisers can create a distorted perception of a product, leading consumers to make decisions based on unrealistic expectations. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the messages they encounter in advertising.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young individuals contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits over community involvement, countless young people actively engage in volunteer work, social activism, and local initiatives.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led environmental organizations. Groups like Fridays for Future, spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, have mobilized millions of young people worldwide to advocate for climate action. These young activists dedicate their time and energy to raising awareness, lobbying governments, and promoting sustainable practices, demonstrating a strong commitment to their communities and the planet.
Furthermore, many young people contribute to their communities through volunteer work. From assisting at local soup kitchens to mentoring underprivileged children, they offer their time and skills to support those in need. These acts of kindness and compassion highlight the inherent desire among young people to make a positive impact on their surroundings.
While it's easy to focus on the perceived lack of community involvement among some young people, it's crucial to recognize the numerous ways in which they contribute. From activism to volunteer work, young individuals are actively shaping their communities and making a difference. The statement that they do not give enough time to helping their communities is simply not accurate and overlooks the significant contributions of many young people.",
"I disagree with the statement, because every age has its own oportunity to enjoy the life. Motivation should be the keyword instead of motion to understand what really lies under enjoying life. 
Against the undeniable power of the energy of young people older people have experiment to defeat the badly results that life carries. This can help the older people to immedietly convert the negative into positive. They only need to motivate themselves and feel confident. 
Enjoying life does not mean having a sportive life, a person can enjoy the life by reading, writing or just by watching and commenting about the things that take place around him. Everyone likes to watch the concept  that they created before. 
Young people have the ability of being more healthy but they don`t have free time and money to achive the activities that they really want. However, older people have the financial power to enjoy these activities if they don`t need to spend so much phyisical effort.     
The enjoys can differ in different ages. The things which are very fantastic in the young hood can be very boring when you are old.

Finally every age contains its own way of life and in every age the person can create some motivation to enjoy tye life.",
"Although it may seem like young people do not contribute to the development of their society as much as in the old days, I strongly believe the opposite. In my opinion, daily life and social issues have become so interrelated that it is difficult to distincly see the youth's contribution to his/her society. Consequently, youngsters help their communities in the form of joining social affiliations, taking active role in political discussions and even working while they take part in educational activities.

One way that youngsters contribute to the well-being of their society is through community work they do in their free time. It is possible to see many university students voluntarily participating in clubs where they have the opportunity to help children, people with disabilities and people who are in need.

Another solid example of youth's contribution to the society is their desire in expressing their political opinions and taking the necessary action. In my opinion, a strong society is the one in which politics can exceed the walls of the parliement. In the country where I live, young people form active groups to contribute to the well-being of their country. Thus, their contribution cannot be neglected.

Finally, it is not so difficult to come across university even high school students working on part-time jobs. To be more specific, half of my friends are both working and studying. Considering the time they need to allocate for their studies, working while studying is not an easy task at all. Thus, it should deserve the society's appreciation. By doing so, the youth makes a significant contribution to the economy of their community.

There are various examples suggesting that the youth is still actively helping their community. Thus, it would be wrong to thing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. It is just that they do it in a different manner than the usual.",
"Nowadays we are involved in an overwhelming stream of advertisements. There are advertisements everywhere, on TV, magazines, even on every corners in the streets and it's impossibile not to notice them, even if you want to. We are not only involved by advertisement, but also strongly influenced, even if sometimes we don't admit it because we are sure that we are superior to certain things, but advertisements are more subdulous that we expect. I agree with the statement, because we are so influenced that we arrive at the point that we buy one thing better than another only because more publicized. And what's the main problem? We trust advertisements too much!!
	Advertisements manage to make things better because there are a lot of minds behind who think how to propose an article to the public, in a way that exalts its best features and hides the worst ones. Adverstising in this way is not correct and loyal towards the public because it isn't honest about the features of the products. How many times we have bought an article, thinking that it's in a particular way or it does particular things while it's actually very different!! And what a disappointment!! I get really angry when it happens to me. For example, when I was a little child I saw on TV a really fantastic little robot which did  (which would have done) a lot of things, such as bringing glasses as a waiter, going alone around the room, recording my voice and playing CDs and so on. But as soon as I brought it to my house I cuold notice that he was able to do only half things that I expected .. maybe because it was a really bad product?? 
	You can object me that this is a generalization, and maybe you're right. I think it too: not all the products are got better in advertisements and not all the companies make advertisements in this incorrect way. Some people are honest and clear about their products and I really appreciate them, because I think that advertisement should be a means to get articles know to the public and to get people who watch TV or read the magazine aware that a particular thing exists, but as it is and not as it should be.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's horizons is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters a more well-rounded individual, equipped with diverse perspectives and the ability to connect ideas across disciplines. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows for a deeper understanding of the world. By exploring various subjects, individuals gain a holistic perspective, recognizing the interconnectedness of different fields. For instance, a historian studying the Renaissance might benefit from understanding the scientific advancements of the period, or an economist might gain valuable insights from studying psychology to understand consumer behavior. This interdisciplinary approach enriches knowledge and fosters a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. 

Secondly, a broad education promotes adaptability and critical thinking. In today's rapidly changing world, individuals need to be able to navigate new challenges and adapt to evolving circumstances. A broad knowledge base equips individuals with the flexibility to apply their skills and knowledge to different situations. For example, a student with a background in literature, history, and science might be better equipped to solve problems in a variety of fields, from marketing to environmental policy. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more enriching and adaptable approach to learning. By exploring a wide range of academic subjects, individuals develop a holistic understanding of the world, foster critical thinking skills, and become more adaptable to the challenges of a constantly evolving society. Therefore, I firmly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, a significant number actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing environmental cleanups to advocating for social justice causes, young people are taking the lead in addressing pressing issues. The recent surge in climate activism, with young people organizing protests and demanding action from governments, is a testament to their commitment to making a difference. 

Furthermore, many young people dedicate their time to volunteering in various organizations. They contribute to local food banks, mentor underprivileged children, or assist elderly individuals in need. These acts of service demonstrate a genuine desire to improve the lives of others and build a stronger community.

While it's important to recognize the challenges young people face, such as academic pressures and financial constraints, it's equally crucial to acknowledge their dedication to community service. Their involvement, whether through activism, volunteering, or simply lending a helping hand, plays a vital role in shaping a better future for everyone. Therefore, it's unfair and inaccurate to claim that young people today are neglecting their communities.",
"It is important to have an idea of many academic subjects, but i think it is more important to specialize in one specific subject, that you can collect a lot of information about this subject ,and you become more efficiant in your work , that you can discover new knowledge about this subject and new field in it, so you can get a good possetion in your work and in your life, and you become specialest in you field .
	That persone who have knowledge of many academic subjects will not collect all the information about the subjects , and he will not become a qualficat persone to work in spesific jobe and to use his knowledge in this job, comparing to that persone who have specialize in one subjct.
	We can think also that the persone who have specializing in one subject should have some knowledge about some subjects , cause he may use them in his life and his job, and he will be more qualefication in any field , at the same time when we think about that persone who have knowledge of many academic subject he can got any job he want, and it will give him more opprtinity in life , that the persone who is specialized in one specific subject may not have a lot of oppertionty to have good job especaly if he has a specialize in a feild which is not populer or an old subject , so he will lose the opertionity to have job , or to work in his feild .
	At these days the life is more developed and thier is a lot of knowldge all over the world, and no one can collect all the knowlege , so the persone should aske about the new specialization and which is effective during a lot of years and become specialized in this subject, at the same time try to collect and read about different issue and different subject to develp his knowledge , and to have more opportinity in life.",
"Many of the people in the world think that young people enjoy life more than older people do, some of the people think that older people enjoy life more than young people do. I aggre with that older people enjoy life more than young people do, because of that they know time is very fast and life gives people only one time.
 Young people always have problems with their life. they never think time is very fast. they only live without scare of death. for example i and my friend always have problems . because of our promblem many of time we dont want to do any things. we often speks about  our problems. we think to go to holiday for reducing from stress. nonethless we post pone it to other summer and other summer never come so we never go to anywhere.                       
 On the other hand, older people think time is very fast. For an example my grandmother always tells me she didnt understand how was she be a older woman. She says that ` i fell myself as a young girl if i had a change to live life again i would travel all over the world`. she always goes cinema for to watch movies. she goes abroad often to visit other countries which she did`nt go before. moreover my grandfather is too interesting old man.he is a good tenis playe. He plays tenis every day. he takes lot of interesting photos to tell life. 
  To sum up, like my grandmother and garadfather older people lenjoyl",
"That  young people enjoy life more than older people is relative of each person. For me a 25 student trying to achieve many things as a good job or high steem reputation the life some times could be stressfull, but it is important to keep a balance between what i  want and what i need.
Some times the older people  have enough benefits to enjoy the rest of their lifes. Of course they worked for all their lifes, and right now  have the money to spend travelling or living in quiet  places where they can rest in peace, but what about those with out the benefits; In contrast there are old people around the word without money or benefits of any kind. They sometimes have to go to the streets asking  for cents so they can live. In this case it would be impossible to get a good quality of life.
On the other hand, the young people have all the chances in front of them. they can live their lifes as they want, sometime rushing in new things without thinking the consecuences. Others young people are more concerns about build a reputation and have good jobs  and that kind of life make them happy. I think that  all depends of  what the people want for themself.
To conlcude, for me is easier to enjoy the life and get the things that i want working as a young person, thus i can start to work in how I want to spend my life as and eldery person, so i could enjoy it when that time comes to.",
"I agree that young people enjoy their lifes more than older people do, but they enjoy their lives in a different way.
Young people do not care if they go to partys on weekends until they are exhausted, burned out, and physically in a bad mood.
Youg people even do not care, about the further problems of alcohol abuse, nicotine abuse and other drugs, they strongly belive that nobody, even themself, could never take their live apart. 
They just live for the moment and do not take responsibilty, because there is nobody for who it would be necassary.

Older people do enjoy their lives otherwise, they are happy, if they can observe growing children, or growing nature with it`s neverending moments of live and death. The just enjoy to be part of a changing and moving world.

So my point of view is that maybe everybody enjoys living, but in a different style. 
Maybe it is not fair to judge somebody if he is enjoying life more than another person. Everybody is individual and thats what makes live enjoyable. So everybody should be lucky to be part of an individual and fast changing world, it doesn`t matter if the person is young or old.

My experience is, the the nothing else effects the mood of a person more than the surrounding and the family, which is responsible for life circumstances. 

Young people may not respect this matter of fact as old people do, they do know how important familylife can be for enjoying life. Children, with devorced parents, may enjoy life than other children with working familys do. It is easy to see that the surroundings are important how and if you can enjoy your life. 

Old people may have more life experience and do know what things they do need to be happy in life, that would explain, why young people experience so much in their teenagerlife until they can stopp and just be happy and lucky about just beeing on earth and enjoying life the way life is.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain carefree spirit and a sense of boundless possibilities, claiming that they experience greater enjoyment is an oversimplification. Both age groups have unique perspectives and challenges that contribute to their overall well-being.


Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and multifaceted. Young people may revel in the excitement of new experiences, the thrill of exploration, and the freedom from responsibilities. However, older individuals often find fulfillment in the satisfaction of achieving long-term goals, the joy of nurturing relationships, and the wisdom gained from years of life experiences. For instance, a young person might find immense pleasure in traveling to a new country, while an older person might derive equal satisfaction from witnessing their children's success or contributing to their community. 

Furthermore, the challenges faced by each age group can significantly impact their enjoyment of life. Young people often grapple with academic pressures, financial instability, and uncertainties about their future. Older individuals may confront health issues, the loss of loved ones, and the realization of their own mortality. While these challenges can be difficult, they also provide opportunities for growth, resilience, and a deeper appreciation for the present moment. 

In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is an overgeneralization. Both age groups have their own unique joys and challenges. True enjoyment is not solely determined by age but by one's ability to find meaning and fulfillment in their individual circumstances.
Ultimately, the pursuit of happiness is a lifelong journey that transcends the boundaries of age.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplification to assume that older individuals experience less joy. In fact, both age groups have unique advantages and challenges that shape their perspectives on life. 

Young people often have the luxury of time and fewer responsibilities. They can pursue their passions, explore new experiences, and take risks without the weight of commitments. For example, a college student might spend a summer backpacking across Europe, an experience that would be difficult for someone with a family and career. However, this freedom comes at a cost. Young people may lack financial stability, experience uncertainty about their future, and struggle with the pressures of finding their place in the world. 

Older people, on the other hand, have accumulated wisdom and experience. They have weathered life's storms and learned valuable lessons. This knowledge allows them to appreciate the simple things in life and find contentment in their relationships and accomplishments. For instance, a retired teacher might find immense joy in spending time with their grandchildren, a privilege they may not have had the time for during their working years. While older individuals may face physical limitations and the loss of loved ones, they often develop a deeper understanding of life's meaning and a sense of peace that comes with age. 

In conclusion, it is inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. Both age groups have their own unique joys and challenges. While youth offers freedom and exploration, age brings wisdom and contentment. Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a personal experience that transcends age and is shaped by individual circumstances and perspectives.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various initiatives and organizations. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work. From participating in local soup kitchens to organizing charity events, they are actively addressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led organizations like 'Free the Children' and 'Global Citizen' showcases their dedication to global causes. These organizations empower young people to advocate for change and raise awareness about critical issues, demonstrating their commitment to making a difference. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to benefit their communities. Many are involved in mentorship programs, tutoring younger students, or participating in environmental initiatives. For example, the 'Earth Day Network' encourages young people to organize clean-up drives and advocate for sustainable practices, highlighting their proactive approach to environmental issues. These actions demonstrate that young people are not simply passive recipients of community service; they are actively shaping and improving their surroundings. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From volunteering to utilizing their skills and talents, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact. Their dedication and commitment to community service should be acknowledged and celebrated, rather than dismissed by sweeping generalizations.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a flawed argument. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, like exploring new experiences and pursuing passions, may not hold the same appeal to an older individual who values stability and contentment.
For example, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive more pleasure from spending time with family and tending to their garden.

Secondly, the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood can bring a different kind of fulfillment.
Older people often find joy in contributing to society, mentoring younger generations, and witnessing the fruits of their labor.
They may also appreciate the wisdom and perspective gained through years of experience, which can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of life. 

Finally, it is important to recognize that happiness and enjoyment are not solely determined by age.
Individuals of all ages can experience periods of joy and sorrow, and it is ultimately their personal outlook and resilience that shape their overall well-being. 

In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain energy and freedom, it is inaccurate to claim that they inherently enjoy life more than older people.
Enjoyment is a subjective experience that evolves throughout life, and both young and old can find fulfillment and happiness in their own unique ways.",
"Young people often wonder about their future, questioning if they will be happier when they get old.  In general, older people lives happier life than the young.
	First point that I want to address is that the older people are more stable emotionally As people become mature as a human being, they would not be tempered as quickly as they used to be. we discover that it is meaningness to be agressive. For example, I hated everyone at school when I was in middleschool. However, when I read To kill a mocking bird, a novel, I started to realize that it is wrong to hate someone with no reason
	Second, older people lives happier life by managing or overcomming their hardships easily. There are times of desperation and sadness in our lives. To prevail frustration is very important to avoid depression and anger, but young people usally does not have ability to do so. Statistics conducted on 2006 showed that there were average thirty students for a day who committed sucide because of their academic pressure. It is relatively bigger average rate than of adults, while it is not ture that students bare more stress than adults. 
	The last thing I have discovered is that older people appreciates things in their life more. My grandmother knows how to appreciate small thing in her life such as sunshine, food, and house; it seems that she gets happy every moment in her life.
In contrast, young people tend to be careless and negative. They say ""Cool"" only when there is a really nice things.  
 
In Conclusion, Older people tend to have happier lifes. By mangaging  frustration, emotional stability, and appreciation of life able them to be happy in every aspects of lives .",
"I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities.Maybe some young people had done enough,but in average level,it's true that most of young people use their time in play and enjoy their living time.
   I think there are some bad condition for the young people in-correct attitude and concept.They think it's not concern with them.Maybe they have much more important things need to do and share their times,so they consider they are very bussy,so they arn't  willing to pay more time to helping their communities.
   I thinkthe best solution that need family ,school and society share the duty to change young people's concept and attitude.So parents ,teachers and government officers need work hard and corporate from now on.Include study and education,let young people why they need pay more attention and time to helping their communities and let they know they have duty to keep this work continuly,when one day they marry and there are chilkdren ,they need transfer this concept to their children all of their life.So make sure this world will keeping opportunity and enough power to helping t and keep their 
communities.
Of course,the government officers can use TV,newspaper and so on to open enough messages about who to helping communities.So most of young people are willing to handle and share enough duty to do it.
At one word,All of people include younger  and elder people ,there are the same duty to keep and helping their their communities,so all of human there are more high quality community lever and society can grow up and implement every century and all over the world continuly and forever.Bless the human can get best communities  for everyone",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the multifaceted nature of happiness and the diverse experiences of individuals across different stages of life. While youth may possess a certain carefree spirit and a sense of boundless possibility, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, older individuals often develop a deeper appreciation for life's simple pleasures and cultivate a sense of contentment that comes with wisdom and experience.
One key difference lies in the perception of time. Young people often view time as an endless resource, allowing them to pursue fleeting pleasures and indulge in spontaneity. However, as people age, they become more aware of the finite nature of time and may prioritize experiences that hold lasting value. This shift in perspective can lead to a greater appreciation for the present moment and a deeper sense of fulfillment.
Moreover, older individuals often have a broader understanding of life's complexities and have learned to navigate challenges with resilience and grace. They have experienced both joy and sorrow, success and failure, and this accumulated wisdom can contribute to a more balanced and nuanced outlook on life. While young people may be more easily swayed by fleeting emotions, older individuals have developed a greater capacity for emotional regulation and can find joy in the quieter moments of life.
In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is an oversimplification. While youth may possess certain advantages, such as physical energy and a sense of adventure, older individuals often develop a deeper appreciation for life's simple pleasures, a greater sense of contentment, and a more nuanced understanding of happiness. Ultimately, enjoyment is a subjective experience that varies greatly from person to person, regardless of age.",
"Some people might say that it is great to have a mastery of a topic. I agree with them but I don't think that being specialized in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reason. 
First, in my opinion, having broad knowledge of a lot of different subjects is very important. Somebody can be very proud to have excellent an knowlege of biology, but is it really useful for today's life? Does he live better than his relatives? I really don't think so. I think that having a broad knowledge is important to live in a society. Indeed, it's more than recomended to know about maths to look after the spendings, to know about politics when time is comed to elected a new president or to give an opinion concerning a new law... Knowing about all these academic topics that pepole use to learn at school is then definitely more useful everydays than having a mastery of one particular topic. Another important point is that some academic subjects are a guideline for people. For instance, history states the errors done in the past, and the persons who are aware of them are lickely to avoid them in the future; Generaly speaking, I would say that all the academic subjects help to live in a society.
Moreover, I wonder how can somebody evoluate, grow up with only studying one specific subject. All the topics we study in class enable us to create our personality. Without them, it's impossible to decide what we like, what we dislike... For example, learning diferent topics definitely help teenagers to know what they want to do in the future. 
To sum up, to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects  is better than specialized in one specific subjects for several reasons: General knowledge is usefull to live in the world and it helps to create the personality.",
"I strongly agree to the statement that the advertisements (Ads) make the products much better than the actual product.
The ads and promotional campaigns are promoting the products to increase their sales and get enough profits but they never take the account of the consumer and its adverse effects on the users.

The daily use products like toiletries and food products , their ads are so tempting that a layman just want to buy them. The ads promotes the products with all those qualities which may not  present. Some time they make the image of the product as it has all super qualities and it is the ultimate solution of all your problems, for example the hair care products. Now a days a lot people are suffering with the hair problems and the companies are promoting the products that it is over night wonder and you will be changed person in 2 days or 14 days or so. But is it really true?? People are just going on the marketing stunts and they buy it with out knowing what are the consequences and side effects of the product. I know some people who have used these dyes and other hair products and now they are suffering with skin problems, which are developed coz of chemicals present in these products.

Similarly the advertisement companies which are promoting the food products. They also ignnore some concrete facts about the ingredients of the product or the quality of product. Recently this truth has been accepted by the Mac Donalds that they are using animal fats in preperation of so called veggy burger. Also, I would like to mention aboout the recent fact that just two days back a big bread company in England has been accused of not maintaining the standard and quality of food  as some glass pieces and hair are found in bread packets.

Thus the consumers should not just believe on the ads as they are for the benefits of the company not for the consumers. But I would not keep all  ads like the promotional ad campaigns run by government and some NGO and societies like WWF, WHO, etc. in to this category. Their ads are genuine and are purpose fully made for the benefit of society and noble cause. These promotional ads should be supported and publicisize.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to resonate. While specialization in a single subject offers profound expertise, I firmly believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic disciplines is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a well-rounded education fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems from diverse perspectives. By engaging with different subjects, students develop a wider range of analytical tools and frameworks. For instance, a student with knowledge in both history and economics can better understand the causes and consequences of economic crises by considering historical precedents. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of complex issues.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals who can navigate diverse fields and adapt to new challenges. A broad knowledge base provides individuals with the flexibility to transition between careers, learn new skills, and thrive in an ever-evolving landscape. For example, a student with a background in literature, science, and technology may be better equipped to succeed in fields like data analysis or artificial intelligence, which require a blend of analytical and creative thinking.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is more valuable in today's complex world. It promotes critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. By embracing a wide range of academic subjects, individuals can develop the skills and perspectives necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving society.",
"I live in Istanbul.It is a city that there are lots of energy due to young population.There are lots of bars,diskos etc.I mean,Istanbul's social life athached with young population.This provides young person to an entertaning life.So,they love and enjoy the life more than older people.
  First of all,being young is a strange thing.You're slowly get in life,seeing lifes' good sides and bad sides.Also you don't have much experiences about life.So,you are following life,but you don't know where it is going.
  In addition to that,nice and enjoying things are coming very nice to you.You are driving car for the first time,maybe you have your first sex experience etc.These are very beautiful experiments.You get exited when you do them all for the first time.These kind of examples makes person much life liker.
  At last but not least,older people also enjoying life.They are travelling world,trying to find new things and trying to find more exitement things.However,many of them can not finding what they are looking for because,whatever they are gonna find is familiar to them.This situation breaks their hope of course.
  In conclusion,young people loves to live.They are addicted to live.Like a man says ""the more you enjoy,then you die"".I guess he is right,a man can not continue to get enjoy from everything in his life.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a genuine desire to make a positive impact. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online activism has provided young people with new platforms to advocate for causes they believe in. From organizing online petitions to raising awareness about social issues, young people are utilizing technology to mobilize their peers and effect change on a larger scale. For example, the #BlackLivesMatter movement, which gained momentum through social media, has sparked important conversations about racial justice and inspired young people to participate in protests and demonstrations. 

Secondly, many young people are actively involved in traditional forms of community service. Volunteering at local soup kitchens, mentoring underprivileged children, or participating in environmental cleanup initiatives are just a few examples of how young people are giving back to their communities. These experiences not only benefit the communities they serve but also provide young people with valuable skills and a sense of purpose. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteering, young people are demonstrating a strong commitment to making a difference in the world. It's crucial to acknowledge and encourage their efforts rather than dismissing them with sweeping statements.",
"Young people, middle age people, old people. I think that people change with the times affecting lots of things like, behaviour, points of view, believings, fears, pleasures, entertainment... I suppose long time ago, people were very worried about building the world up, but nowadays developed countries have created a mass media- business world. Ancient times were seasons for learning, for knowledge, for wisdom, for care about human nature, as books are showing us every time we open one of them. And we can't make divisions between young or old people, but talk about societies. In my humble opinion, societies that care about education had always great results as ancient Greeks or for example Japanese, Nowadays we can feel a sense of corruption everywhere, because it seems that societies have forgotten about education. Young people are worried for example for their weight, cause if they don't look like the models that the mass media distributes around the continents, they think they are not socially accepted. But this mass media also show them everytime-everywhere, those high fat products with smiles and perfect bodies, treating them. Young people care about fashion, about the last clothing, the last film, the last videogame, or the last musical tendency. In this sense, we can say that they create their own communities in different trends. For example, a disc jockey, feeds their public every night, with the best music he can play to entertain people, as mozart creates great composing music for the court time ago. In such way they are helping the community, but in ways never humanity has done. Young people try to hide, or to do the opposite, sometimes, that adults use to do. I know it sounds like a child behaviour but you can see it. Another times, another people, another worries, new social mental diseases... As a part of the society, the world has a lot of things to worry about, and I think the best weapon people ever had was education.",

People want to get more thiongs from the life. People using a lot of ideas to creative the things what they want.

	Many companies they made many DM and adertisments to attract their coutomers. For the company, they just want to people to buy their products. The advertisements just a way to present their thoughts.However, the real product is not really like the advertisement. 
	The advertisement is an idea that the company want to express their thought to their customers. Maybe they did not take about more how to use the products. They want to the climents to keep their eyes on. That is buniness.
 	 On the ther hand, now there are many companies that they sale their stuffs in the TV show. They provide the tset time to use their products.

"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate their time and energy to making a positive impact on their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways.
One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing local food drives to spearheading environmental clean-up campaigns, young people are taking the lead in addressing social issues. The internet and social media platforms have empowered them to mobilize their peers and raise awareness for causes they care about. For instance, the recent surge in climate change activism, spearheaded by young people like Greta Thunberg, demonstrates their commitment to making a difference on a global scale.
Furthermore, young people are increasingly volunteering their time and skills in various sectors. From mentoring underprivileged children to assisting at local hospitals, they are contributing to the well-being of their communities. Many educational institutions also encourage community service, fostering a sense of civic responsibility among students. These experiences not only benefit the communities served but also provide young people with valuable skills and a sense of purpose.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's important to recognize their diverse contributions to their communities. From leading social movements to volunteering their time and skills, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact.

"It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. Most advertisements, in my opinion, tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks of products, creating an idealized image that often falls short of reality. 

One compelling reason for this discrepancy lies in the inherent nature of advertising. Advertisers aim to capture attention and persuade potential customers, often employing techniques that distort the truth. For instance, commercials frequently showcase products in unrealistic settings, using professional models and flawless lighting to create an illusion of perfection. This manipulation can mislead consumers into believing that the product will deliver the same level of satisfaction in their everyday lives. 

Furthermore, advertisements often focus on highlighting specific features while conveniently omitting crucial information. Take, for example, the marketing of fast food restaurants. While their commercials may showcase mouthwatering burgers and crispy fries, they rarely mention the high calorie content, unhealthy ingredients, or potential long-term health consequences. This selective presentation of information can lead consumers to make uninformed choices that may ultimately harm their well-being. 

In conclusion, the vast majority of advertisements present a distorted view of products, exaggerating their benefits and downplaying their limitations. This deliberate manipulation is driven by the desire to attract customers and generate profits, often at the expense of providing accurate information. Consumers must remain vigilant and critically evaluate advertising claims, recognizing that the reality of a product may differ significantly from its idealized portrayal in advertisements.",

Firstly, the rise of social media and online activism has provided young people with new avenues for community involvement. Through online platforms, they can raise awareness for social issues, organize fundraising campaigns, and mobilize volunteers for various causes.

In conclusion, while it's tempting to paint a picture of young people as apathetic towards community service, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, young people are actively engaged in making a difference, proving that the statement is an oversimplification of a complex issue.",
"I disagree to this concept because if most of the advertisment contains a false knowledge for thier product. nobody will believe any of the advertisment.which leads a lack of knowledge for a consumer which is the most suitable product to buy.that means that all the money budget for the advertisment gone for nothing.moreover, it will cause the hatrege of the consumer to the company, even if they sell a varies kind of products.but its better for the advertisment companies to have a funny advertisment in the tv .after that announce the name of the product.In that way everybody  body will remember the product because of the funny advertisment.
      the only effective time to advertise about products is when you have a low amount of products .and the company want to get red of it.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks of products, creating an idealized image that often falls short of reality. 

One compelling reason for my stance is the use of persuasive language and imagery. Advertisements often employ evocative words and captivating visuals to evoke emotions and create a sense of desirability. For instance, a commercial for a new car might showcase stunning scenery and a glamorous lifestyle, implying that owning the car will bring happiness and fulfillment. However, the reality is that the car itself may not be as luxurious or reliable as portrayed. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on selective information and misleading claims. They often highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any negative features or potential drawbacks. For example, a weight loss product might advertise rapid results without mentioning the possible side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise. Such selective presentation can lead consumers to make uninformed decisions based on incomplete information. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can provide valuable information about products, they often present a distorted and unrealistic view. Their use of persuasive language, imagery, and selective information creates an idealized image that rarely matches the actual experience. Therefore, it is essential for consumers to approach advertisements with a critical eye and to rely on independent research and reviews before making purchasing decisions.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old question of breadth versus depth arises. While specialization in a single subject offers a profound understanding, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This perspective stems from the interconnectedness of knowledge, the development of critical thinking, and the adaptability it fosters.
Firstly, the world is a complex tapestry woven from various disciplines. History, science, literature, and the arts are not isolated islands but rather interconnected threads that influence and inform each other. A broad knowledge base allows individuals to see the bigger picture, understanding how different subjects interact and contribute to a holistic understanding of the world. For instance, studying history alongside economics provides a deeper understanding of economic trends and their historical context.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. Exposure to diverse perspectives and methodologies from different subjects challenges assumptions and encourages intellectual curiosity. It allows individuals to analyze information from various angles, weigh evidence, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking ability is invaluable in navigating the complexities of modern life, where information is abundant and often conflicting.
Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters adaptability. In an era of rapid technological advancements and evolving job markets, individuals with specialized knowledge may find themselves limited in their career options. A broad education, on the other hand, equips individuals with a diverse skill set and the ability to learn new concepts quickly. This adaptability is crucial for navigating the uncertainties of the future and thriving in a constantly changing world.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more comprehensive understanding of the world, enhances critical thinking skills, and fosters adaptability. It is this holistic approach to learning that empowers individuals to thrive in a complex and ever-changing world.",
"I agree that.
 In my case, I agree.  There are few reasons.
 First of all, having a lot of Knowledge makes me live easily and useful.  For example, When I see a TV news program, I can understand almost of every issues and have my own opinions against them.
 Secondly,  having a plently of broad Knowledge means having a lot of topics to talk about.  For example, when I go to a party, I have to talk to a person who I don't know. At the time, we should talk something.  If I know a lot of topics, making a conversation is easily. When we first meet a person, we don't talk about specific subject deeply except some kind of academic meetings.
 Ofcourse, a person who mastered a specific subject can help many person or things. For example, doctors, lowers, scientists, etc.
 However, I am not the kind of person.  My way is that ask a specialist when I don't know.  So, they are.
 Conclude, I agree that it is better to know many subjects than to know one specific subject.",

"The question states that, thesedays, young people  do not give enough time to helping their communities. I agree with this statment.
Thesedays, i think because young people do not  mind that ,if their community gets risk or something not like old people. Actually they do not think their rights to do for their community, People have right to vote, paying tax, In korea, men have to go to army. but some young people do not give to helping their community.
    Firstly, Young people do not go for voting for their community, They go for a trip or abroad instead, or some people go to migration to other country, so then they do not participate their community eventhough they have a right to vote. Therfore the less people is vote for their community and they get unsatisfaction their head of community.

  Secoundly, Youn people do not pay their tax to their community. so then the community cannot operate their work for the community. young people donot mind about the community. 

 Finally, In korea , men have to go to army when they  over 20 years old, but some tuong people go to migration to ecape from the government that try to catch him because he does not go to army. or sometimes they are try to get ill, so then they would not go to army. It is being the most big problem in korea. 

   I agree that the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. It should be changed, and then all of the communitie can operate better.",
"The issue at hand is whether to have a baisc knowledge of many acedemic subjects or to speciialize in one subjects. In my opinion it is better to specialize in one subject rather than to have basic knowledge of many subjects. This is because alot of time and energy will be spent on studying many subjects. On the other hand by specializing in one subject a person can have full knowledge of that subject and advance in that field.

First reason of my belief to specialize in one subject is that the bounderies of knowlegde is too large for one individual to cover. Knowledge is an infinite ocean and is very difficult for an individual to acquire it even the basic of it. While studying one subject will be much easier and useful since then a person can apply his or her knowledge.

Secondly i think one should specialize in a subject because by studying too many subjects the individual might get confused. The individual in the process of learning many subjects might not be able to learn even one subject properly which wiil render all his studying useless since his brain will be distracted by too much information. Studying one subject will not distract the individual since he will have only one subject to concentrate on.

Lastly it is better specialize in one spefic subject because studying one subject will make an individual better and better each day in that subject. The person will command an expertize on the subject, which ensures his progress and development.

Thus for a person to advance and progress in life he or she should specialize in one subject rather than acquiring the knowledge of many subjects and end up in learning nothing.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives addressing social issues. From organizing environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice, young people are utilizing their creativity and passion to make a tangible difference.

"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a simplistic and inaccurate view. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, such as pursuing new experiences and social connections, may not hold the same appeal for an older individual who values stability and deeper relationships.
For example, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might derive greater pleasure from spending time with their grandchildren.

Secondly, the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood can lead to a different kind of fulfillment.
Older people often find satisfaction in their careers, families, and contributions to society.
They may have a greater sense of purpose and accomplishment, which can contribute to their overall well-being.
For instance, a retired teacher who has dedicated their life to educating young minds might find immense joy in seeing their former students succeed.
In conclusion, it is impossible to definitively state that young people enjoy life more than older people.
Both stages of life offer unique opportunities for happiness and fulfillment.
The key to enjoying life lies in finding meaning and purpose, regardless of age.
Instead of comparing the experiences of different age groups, we should celebrate the diversity of human experiences and recognize that joy can be found at every stage of life.",
"When it asked which is better , exclusive reading or inclusive reading , however , people rarely come to absolutely consensus at such a controversial issue. Some people attach more improtance on the broad knowledge , But as to me, i can not accept the statement state above.  Because the argument is too extreme .

As far as some subjects concerned we need to focus more attention on the specific subject and think it deeper. Those more concrete ones like, biotechnology , agriculture ,  medecne and so on . These subject  require more related information about it. Subject like medicine need not only aboudant knowledge but also adequate experience.  The following example that is a persuasive one. Imagine that , what will happen if a doctor focus more attention on economy instead of patient and medical books . The concequence is definitely undesirable . 

Not doubt broad knowledge is very significant to some scholars in specific realm. For instance , some subject , such as those abstract ones , like history , philosophy, politics ,administration, archeology need a wide range of knowledge .  These sort of scholars expecially in  the field of administration, should have more common sense than the other subject , because when face with difficult situation they can make a fast decision base , all these need more comprehensive learning of some knowledge such as history ,  economy, politics so on and so forth.

According to what have been discussed about , i believe this question is depend on personal inclination.",
"Nowadays advertisement became very popular for the companies. Especially the bigger companies are using this argument very frequently. In my opinion advirtesements make products seem better than they really are.  The goal of the companies which is maximizing the profits and the competition between the companies provides this stiuation.

Companies are using advirtesement arguments for increasing their profits. To achieve their aim they are showing their products differently. For example, once I saw an advertisement about a digital dictionary on the television. When I saw the dictionary I decided to buy one. Because It has a o lot of functions which are very beneficial for me. It is also said that the use of the dictionary is very simple. Next day I went to the shop to buy one. When I saqw the real one I was shocked. First it was not practical as it was said on the television. On the other hand the size of the dictionary was very big which is a problem for carrying it. 

Sometimes the competition between the companies may cause this situation. Today a lot of company are competing bacuse they are producing the same products. Each of them wants to raise their own profits. There are two big companies in Turkey which are producing the same product, knifes. They are emphasizing the sharpness of their knifes in the advirtesements. Both of them want to prove that their knifes quality is better than other company's knife. For that reason sometimes they are giving untrue knowledge about the qualifications of their knifes.

"Do really the young people enjoy like more the life than older people do? I do not think that would be the complete answer. At present, not all the young people enjoy the life more than older ones.

   Nowadays there is a huge development in new technologies, such as electronics, giving us new items and facilities such as cell phones, internet and worlwide communications that were out of mind when the older people were young. But this also, is the responsible of a more stressfull lifestyle in the actual youth.
     
    Most of the time, these are the causes of the increasing number of young people that commit suicide and suffers depression. Young people is still learning to live, but in a world totally different of the older man. Today there is more competition for all, even for finding a job, now a man does not have to compete against the others that live in the same city or region but if does with the men around the world. This causes a more difficult stressfull situations in young people that derives in a less enjoyable life experience.
   
   Sometimes the inexperience of young people in taking decisions about their own life are stressfull situations, and sometimes they take this in the wrong way. The necessity to make all the things faster and better that have the majority of youngs, acts against them.     
    The older people now take advantages of the advances in  medicine than can increase their life quality, and in some cases, to cure the illness known to commonly affect them. They, in opposition to young people are mature enough and have their lifes fully realized that makes them available to have more enjoyable experiences than some of the actual youth generation. 
    
    I think that the way the young people can enjoy better the life than older people is by taking in account the advises and wisdom of old people. We have to remember the old people have already walked by the way the young ones are barely trying to go throw.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a generalization that overlooks the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and amplifying their impact. For example, the recent surge in online activism surrounding environmental issues demonstrates the power of young people to advocate for change through digital platforms. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work and community organizations. From tutoring underprivileged children to cleaning up local parks, they dedicate their time and skills to address pressing social issues. Many schools and universities also encourage community service as part of their curriculum, fostering a sense of civic responsibility among students. The prevalence of youth-led organizations focused on social justice, environmental sustainability, and other causes further highlights their commitment to community betterment. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to stereotype young people as self-absorbed, the reality is that they are actively engaged in community service in various ways. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, they are making a difference in their communities and contributing to a better future. It's important to acknowledge and celebrate their efforts, rather than dismissing their contributions as insufficient.",
"I support the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I would like to support this with the following observations from my personal experiences.
With the advent of technology, a greater number of means are available for young people to enjoy life. When I was kid the aveneues for enjoying were limited in India. Now kids at young age have different options such as video games which I never had an access to. This translates to the older people too, who would have no access to these gadgets. Even if they have access they have to develop the aptitude and zeal to learn how to operate these devices.

In the era of consumerism more and more products are offered for the young generation because they control the spending.Companies that tailor their offerings to the old people are between far and few. I feel this also has to do with the age. As people grow they become more mature,their interests change and they also tend be more appreciative of the needs of the family members. As a result they curb their activities and go into their own shell.

Last but not the least ,with the onset of the old age people start suffering with various ailments that take off their most time. They have to restrict or avoid outdoor fun activities which they would have done in their younger years. 
Having said that young people enjoy life more , I would not like to state that old people do not enjoy life at all. But as discussed above the means change as the time passes and they start limiting their activities.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and energy to making a positive impact on their communities.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives focused on environmental sustainability. From organizing beach cleanups to advocating for renewable energy, young people are actively addressing pressing issues that affect their communities. Their passion and innovative ideas are driving change and inspiring others to join the movement.

Furthermore, many young people are deeply involved in volunteering at local organizations. They contribute their time and skills to support vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, homeless, or those with disabilities. These acts of kindness and compassion demonstrate a genuine commitment to improving the lives of others.
While it's important to acknowledge the challenges faced by young people, such as academic pressure and financial constraints, it's equally crucial to recognize their dedication to community service. Their contributions, both large and small, are making a tangible difference in the world. Therefore, it's unfair and inaccurate to claim that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities. They are actively engaged in making a positive impact, and their efforts deserve to be acknowledged and celebrated.",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge across various academic subjects or specialize in one specific field has become increasingly pertinent. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is more advantageous for individuals in the long run. This essay will explore the reasons why a well-rounded education is crucial for success in a multifaceted society. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and solve problems from diverse perspectives. In a world where disciplines are increasingly intertwined, the ability to draw upon knowledge from different fields is essential for innovation and problem-solving. For instance, a scientist with a broad understanding of history and philosophy might be better equipped to understand the ethical implications of their research. Similarly, a business leader with knowledge of art and literature might be more adept at understanding consumer behavior and creating innovative marketing strategies. 

Secondly, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in the face of change. The job market is constantly evolving, and individuals with specialized skills may find themselves ill-prepared for new challenges. A broad knowledge base, however, equips individuals with the ability to learn new skills and adapt to changing circumstances. For example, a person with a strong foundation in liberal arts might be able to transition smoothly from a career in journalism to one in public relations, leveraging their skills in writing, communication, and critical thinking. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its place, a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in today's world. It allows individuals to think critically, solve problems creatively, and adapt to changing circumstances. By embracing a holistic approach to education, individuals can equip themselves with the tools necessary to thrive in a complex and dynamic society.",
"In the realm of education, the age-old debate between breadth and depth of knowledge continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization in a specific subject offers undeniable advantages, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This essay will explore the reasons why a well-rounded education provides a more valuable foundation for personal and professional growth. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By encountering diverse perspectives and methodologies from various disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles and synthesize complex ideas. For instance, a student with a broad understanding of history, economics, and psychology can better comprehend the multifaceted nature of social issues and formulate more nuanced solutions. 

Secondly, a broad education enhances adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's interconnected and dynamic society, individuals are constantly faced with new challenges and opportunities. A broad knowledge base equips them with the flexibility to navigate these changes and embrace new fields of study or work. For example, a graduate with a broad background in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is better positioned to adapt to emerging technologies and contribute to innovation across various industries. 

Finally, a broad education cultivates well-rounded individuals with a deeper understanding of the world. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain insights into diverse cultures, historical events, and scientific discoveries. This exposure broadens their horizons, fosters empathy, and promotes a more holistic worldview. For instance, studying literature, art, and philosophy can cultivate a deeper appreciation for human creativity and the complexities of human experience. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters critical thinking, enhances adaptability, and cultivates well-rounded individuals with a deeper understanding of the world. Therefore, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",
"Nowadays, young people usually use most of their time socializing with their buddies, having parties, go surfing, go skiing and have. They enjoy their life so much. They think they have so much time to spend with. They don't need to worry about getting old.
Yet, most sophiscate older people find their ways of life. They find their goal, their dream and they are keeping forward in their life. Cause they had been young, they knew they made some wrong decision before. They are willing to make it up for them and make a better life. To me, I disagree young people enjoy life more than older people do.


      Day in and day out, it is not hard to find young people commit suicide, they take drug and go to rave parties. It seems they are so enjoy with their life. In fact, they are wasting their precious time. Numerous of young people try to have different kind of leisure in order to get rid of their stress like exam, complicated love relationship, family scold. In contrast, most older people have experience to know what mistakes they did on the past, they feel everyday is a good day, they enjoy their lifes. They feel life is too short. Besides, they usually have more capitals to let them do more things like traveling. Most voluntaries are from older people, they are more willing to give. They want to help people who are indeed. This is exactly what life should be. Life is about happiness, older people arrive a destination that they can share their joy to other people.


       Next, when you see older people, you will always find a happy face from them. It is because they realize that life is running fast. So many worries that they had had before was not a big deal. Their valuable experience provides them with a critical thinking. They mostly choose a better choices than young people do. It always give a better result. This critical thinking makes their life easier and enjoy the fruitful result in their life.",
"Nowadays, most companies if not all of them, rely on advertisement to make a certain product or object known and valuable. They actually use the advertisement to compete with other companies and sell more. However, are the advertisements the real image of what products really are, and how much they cost ?

	Unfortunately, most customers are getting a ""disappointed"" feeling when buying a certain product, or after having bought it. For example, when we see an advertisement about a car, the price is usually without taxes, and without any options. However, when the customer sees the panel, he would get excited about the price meeting his own budget. So he would go and prepare his savings and tell everyone about it. Then, when buying the car, the company would tell him: "" Excuse me sir, do you need it with an automatic transmission ? Do you want the windows to be electrically controlled? "" And with every question coming, the customer's smile would give place to a sarcastic and fake smile, that would totally disappear with: "" Excuse me sir, this price was without taxes."" Now, can the customer change his mind after the price increased by a couple of thousands of dollars? It's not that easy, after having sold his own car, for example, and having told everyone about the new vehicle he was going to buy. 
	On the other side, some companies have the option to refund their customers if they aren't satisfied about the product. However, how many customers will actually have the time to go and ask for a refund about his product? In addition, will it be a total refund? In most cases it is not. They would try to sell you another product instead of the older one. 

	Finally, we can realise nowadays that most of what we see on televisions and panels isn't true. ""Lying"" to people will actually make companies lose on the long run, because a disappointed customer will not come back. Therefore, every company is in a dilemna between ""showing off"" and losing on the long run, and giving the world the real image of their products.",
"I do not agree with this statement has provided. Young people could enjoy life in many different ways in present than past days however I do think the word,""Enjoy"" means solely living without any worries.
	First, Old people experienced many ways in life and these experiences bring to enjoy life.
When I first saw this statement, I came up with many different experiences that I heard from my grandmother and mother.  Simply, Old people lived more than young people did and this shows how old people experienced many different situations before the young people. They already experienced and survived many different situations, so they deserve to enjoy life. 
	Second, Old people would have their children and grand children and to see how their own children growing and giving  new births, are the real meaning of  enjoy life.
I came up with this topin sentence to thinking about my grandmother in South Korea. Even though I haven't seen her in past five years, I will never forget all the words that my grandmother told me. In my experience, since I was young, my grandmother told me to respect parents and having family is the most happy thing in life. As well as she told me that Young people could enjoy life in their ways however, they have more responsibilities about schoosl, futurse, jobs, and many more things until they think finished everything. My grandmother told me that she has children and grand children and they all grown up to work everything by themselves so she doesn't have to worry about future. When she first thought about what is the real meaning of enjoy life, she said that even though she's getting older and everything wasn't like when she was young but only her mind was more peaceful and comfortable than when she was young. As I heard that, I did think that I want to live like my grandmother. 
	In conclusion, Young people enjoy life as what they feel about to enjoy however, I do think old people do enjoy life more freely and happily than young people do and they should have to because they deserved to enjoy life.",
"Young people could be the most encouraged members of a community but not all are the same kind of person. I grew up in a small town with approximately 36000 inhabitants. I attended a youth club that was leaded by the church. We did a lot of things for our community.
First, we meet to discuss problems in our city. Every wendsday there is a discussing round about current problems, e.g. about vandalism in our old town.
Moreover we organize parties and events where we collecte money for different programs to help other people. It is a very good feeling to have fun on a party and at the same time helping others.
We also make  trips to help underpreviledged people to renew their houses. 
These are some examples of our community work and I hope that they show why I am disagreeing with the statement. But I also know that such a community work is not generell. I think especially in big cities it is a great problem that young people do not spend enough time to helping their communities. But I think this is quite normal. They are not as closely connected to their community as I am. I suppose that they even do not have the chance to be directly involved. There are to many problems in big cities that hardly can be solved by youth.
But I also believe that many young people are not interested in their community because they only think about their own wishes and problems. They are not able to connect these two things. I mean own problems and community problems. I think they often stand closely together.
I would summarize that this is a difficult problem which is not easy to solve but I think that not all young people are lazy like it is maintained from many adults.

"Majority of people are really effected from advertisements;as a result of that companies use this way to support the consumption of their products.I agree with the statement that products seem better in most advertisments.Not tested products are selling on markets/

	Firstly;the most important thing is to effect women who spend most of their time by shopping.Especially make up products are on market with just small changes. By changing its  cover or smell its sold like a new product.Also hygenic products must be tested.Sometimes in advertisements it says;our new product is for sensitive and allergetic person nonethless when you use it you see that it is not real.Secondly children want to buy whatever they see;Bright covers or little toys which are given with the product effects them.

	On the other hand with the improvement of technology new products are on market each day. For example last month I bought a new mobile phone  which I saw an advertisement on TV.It is said hat it does not effected from water and I dropped it in the rainy weather and as a result I can not use it anymore.After market services must be effected
	
		In conclusion;I agree with the statement that sometimes advertisements are not showing the truth.They mostly the new producing way of a product with small changes.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial, fostering adaptability, critical thinking, and a well-rounded perspective. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's rapidly evolving world, skills and knowledge quickly become obsolete. Having a diverse understanding of various subjects allows individuals to readily transition between fields, learn new skills, and remain relevant in the job market. For instance, a person with a broad background in humanities and sciences might be able to seamlessly move from a career in research to one in marketing, leveraging their analytical skills and communication abilities. 

Furthermore, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By understanding different perspectives and disciplines, individuals can approach challenges from multiple angles, leading to more innovative and effective solutions. For example, a historian studying the causes of a war might draw insights from economics, psychology, and political science to gain a comprehensive understanding of the conflict. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base cultivates a well-rounded perspective on the world. Exposure to diverse subjects allows individuals to appreciate different cultures, ideologies, and ways of thinking. This fosters empathy, tolerance, and a deeper understanding of the complexities of human society. For instance, studying literature from different cultures can broaden one's understanding of human experiences and emotions, fostering a sense of global citizenship. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers invaluable advantages in today's dynamic world. It promotes adaptability, critical thinking, and a well-rounded perspective, ultimately enriching individuals' lives and preparing them for the challenges of the 21st century.",
"what i think about this case is goin for the first choise which is ,its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, because when a person have that knowledge about the academic subjects other than in one specific subject, sure a person would have a job which has a one specific subject for exampel, a doctor,his feild or his main subject that a doctor should be know about it is medican and body since in general , but that dose not mean he only have to know what about his job only, well whats wrong about haveing knowledge about other things for example, a knowledge of art, how great is to find a doctor wich his clinic is full of his art work or some he bought in his own taste of art, a normal person if he walks in a place like that he would say that this doctor is not like any other doctor.
   having a broad knowledge is some thing really great from some to get usd from it, it can be very help ful in some positions, for example some people are siting and talking about some field of studing, and they all have a knowledge about many academic subjects exepet one person whose now interested to have aother knowledge of what he have, what if these people opend a subject far from this person field or specific subject, what his position would be like, and what if some of these people askd him about some thing in the other field of his, after that, that person would think that he was wrong about stiking in one specific subject knowing all about it, from that stuiations people change their minds about what they have made.
  so for not being in that kind of positions i agree and 100% support having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.",

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it's better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. This is because it fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to think critically and make informed decisions. By being exposed to various disciplines, one develops the ability to analyze information from multiple perspectives, identify biases, and evaluate evidence. For instance, a student with a broad understanding of history, economics, and political science can better analyze current events and form their own opinions.
Secondly, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals with diverse skills and the ability to learn new things quickly. A broad education equips individuals with the foundation to adapt to new challenges and embrace emerging fields. For example, a person with a background in literature, philosophy, and computer science might be well-suited to work in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence.
Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. Different disciplines are not isolated silos but rather interconnected threads woven into the fabric of human understanding. By exploring various subjects, individuals gain a holistic perspective and appreciate the intricate relationships between seemingly disparate fields. For instance, studying art history alongside physics can reveal the influence of scientific discoveries on artistic movements.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It promotes critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. Therefore, I believe that it is ultimately more beneficial to pursue a broad education that encompasses diverse subjects rather than specializing in a single field.",

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in traditional forms of community service. Volunteering at local soup kitchens, mentoring underprivileged children, and participating in neighborhood clean-up initiatives are just a few examples of their contributions. Many schools and universities encourage and facilitate student involvement in community service projects, fostering a sense of civic responsibility and promoting social awareness. These experiences provide young people with valuable skills and a deeper understanding of the needs of their communities. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make generalizations about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities.

"I don't agree with the following statement: ""Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities."" I believe that they are in fact investing more time into supporting their communities that their predecessors did. 

To raise a few specific reasons regarding this point, they are as follows:

First, thanks to political maturity and stability in Korea, most of the Korean students are not involved in the wild student movements any more. They purely think about their academic affairs and building whole character through helping those who are in needs. For example, it is often noted that many young stuedents visit the homeless people in the vicinity of their schools and provide food and some medicines.

Second, the higher educational institutions like universities and colleges restarted the education of theory and the practice of ethical education. These school authorities specifically have developed and initiatied multiple 'Community Support Programs', and are encouraging their studednts to actively participate in them. 

Third, the strength of the students' community support activities are in that the students can enjoy sufficient time to help the communities during their regualr vacations in summer and winter. Moreover, many of thier parents and their school authorities are not sparig any financial assistance for the people.

Fourth, from a systematic approach, it is very clear that almost all lower and higher educational institutions throughout the country are focusing on graduating students of whole character. It is known that the students are, to some extend, required to plan and carry out their respective community support activities during the summer and winter vacations. Also, as a matter of course, the school authorities give credits to them. 

In conclusion, young people's proactive participation into the community support activities is very much desirable societal phenomena. Their spirit and enthusiasm have to be further nourished and encouraged by every segment of the society.",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a topic of much debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial for both personal and professional growth. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Exposure to diverse subjects allows individuals to see connections and relationships between seemingly disparate fields. For instance, understanding history can provide context for current events, while studying literature can enhance communication and analytical skills. This interdisciplinary approach enables individuals to approach problems from multiple perspectives, leading to more innovative and comprehensive solutions. 

Furthermore, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability and resilience in a constantly changing world. In a globalized and technology-driven society, individuals are constantly required to learn new skills and adapt to new situations. Having a broad understanding of various subjects equips individuals with the flexibility to navigate these changes and embrace new opportunities. For example, someone with a broad knowledge of science and technology might be better equipped to transition into a new field or adapt to technological advancements. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous in the long run. It fosters critical thinking, enhances adaptability, and prepares individuals for the complexities of a rapidly changing world. By embracing interdisciplinary learning and pursuing a diverse range of knowledge, individuals can unlock their full potential and navigate the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a generalization that overlooks the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to making a positive impact on their communities. This essay will argue that the statement is overly simplistic and fails to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of youth involvement.
Firstly, young people are increasingly active in volunteer organizations and social initiatives. From participating in environmental cleanups to mentoring underprivileged children, they demonstrate a strong desire to give back. For instance, the rise of youth-led movements like the climate change activism spearheaded by Greta Thunberg showcases their commitment to addressing pressing social issues. These individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices to advocate for change.
Secondly, technological advancements have opened up new avenues for community engagement. Social media platforms and online fundraising campaigns allow young people to connect with causes they care about and mobilize support from a wider audience. The recent surge in online activism, where young people use social media to raise awareness about social injustices and organize protests, exemplifies their ability to leverage technology for community betterment.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people's lack of community involvement, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute.

"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibilities, it is a misconception to assume that this translates to a greater enjoyment of life. 

Firstly, youth is often characterized by a lack of perspective. Young people may experience intense emotions, but they may struggle to understand the nuances of life's challenges and triumphs. They may be more easily swayed by fleeting pleasures and less equipped to appreciate the deeper satisfactions that come with age and experience. For instance, a young person might find immense joy in a new video game, while an older person might derive greater fulfillment from a successful career or a strong family bond.
Secondly, older people have a greater capacity for self-awareness and emotional maturity. They have lived through a wider range of experiences, both positive and negative, and have learned to navigate the complexities of life with greater wisdom. This allows them to appreciate the simple joys of life, such as spending time with loved ones or pursuing personal passions, in a way that young people may not fully grasp.

In conclusion, while youth may offer a certain carefree energy, it is not a guarantee of greater enjoyment of life. Older people, with their accumulated wisdom and perspective, often possess a deeper understanding and appreciation for the richness and complexity of human experience. To suggest that one age group enjoys life more than another is to overlook the unique and evolving nature of happiness throughout the lifespan.",
"""Young people enjoy life more than older people do"" yes, It is correct because due the development of the country. In the olden day is no such type of facilities which we are enjoying in this days.
   Young people will enjoy a much because the parents were being the educated people.Now a day the generation is also little bit faster than the previous generation the main reason is the due to increasing the development in the cities.
Young people were enjoying a lot with the help of new technology ,people were enjoying life  with there needs and the people were learning the education with the happiest way .
   
In olden days there is no proper education to learn and people were educated a little thepeople were satisfied with there education.But the young people were not compromising in the education so that the they are studying upto the graduation or more.
     young people were enjoying the life with there education, people that they are enjoying with the education and they were enjoying other activities also like sports.entertainment etc.

Young people are actively engaged in various ways, demonstrating their commitment to improving their communities through volunteer work, skill-based contributions, and acts of kindness. It's crucial to recognize and appreciate the diverse ways in which young people are making a positive impact on their surroundings.",
"Being young or being older influence the decisions, personal characters and the way of life, as well. By statement the way of life, I refer not only type of living but also the enjoment of that life. Do young people enjoy life more than the elderly? I agree with that statement, because youngsters are more enegetic, not stessful about the future, and not reluctand to experince new things. On the other hand, due their valuable experinces, senior citizens could have chance to enjoy more than youth.

Firstly, the younger people, due to very biological and hormonal feature of their bodies, are very enegetic, which could not be compared to energy of older people. Being energetic gives youngsters a chance to do too many things within very short periods of time. On the other hand, elderly even there are too many energetic old people, cannot due the same amount of things within the same period and also within the same quality.

Secondly, young people do not worry to much about their prospective futures. Of course, they have some kind of concerns about their careers and study but it is better to think about the end of the life like somehow elderly do. It is more probable to the elderly to feel deppressive due to feeling old. 

Finally, younger people do not have any oppositions against living and experiencing new things, such as new tastes, new adventures and even new friends. In contrast, senior citizens generally prefer to live in peace rather than in adventures. They have more concerns to continiue the stablity of their lives, which makes them somehow conservative, as well.

In addition, we should not forget that due to their valuable expereinces, elderly in some cases can enjoy the life more. For instance, their experinces allow them to know what to do in which time.
I hold the view that younger people enjoy life better and more than elderly.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, the social pressures of fitting in and navigating complex relationships can contribute to stress and uncertainty. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find excitement in new experiences and adventures, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from the comfort of routine and the wisdom gained through years of experience. For example, a young person might find joy in traveling to a new country, while an older person might find contentment in spending time with loved ones or pursuing hobbies they have cultivated over time. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not solely dependent on age. Both young and old individuals have the potential to experience happiness and fulfillment, albeit in different ways. While youth may offer a sense of freedom and exploration, older age brings wisdom, stability, and a deeper appreciation for the simple joys of life. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance and a sense of limitless possibilities, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, older individuals often possess a deeper appreciation for life's nuances and a more profound understanding of happiness. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can detract from their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming, leaving little room for carefree exploration. Conversely, older individuals may have achieved a level of stability and security that allows them to focus on personal fulfillment and leisure activities. They have the time and resources to travel, pursue hobbies, and spend quality time with loved ones, all of which contribute to a sense of contentment. 

Furthermore, older people have accumulated a wealth of experiences that shape their perspective on life. They have witnessed both triumphs and setbacks, learned from their mistakes, and developed a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. This wisdom allows them to appreciate the simple joys of life and find happiness in the present moment. Young people, on the other hand, may be caught up in the pursuit of novelty and excitement, overlooking the beauty and satisfaction that can be found in everyday experiences. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with a certain level of carefree enjoyment, it is not necessarily indicative of a greater capacity for happiness. Older individuals often possess a more mature and nuanced understanding of life, allowing them to find fulfillment and contentment in ways that young people may not yet appreciate. The enjoyment of life is a complex and multifaceted experience that evolves throughout our lifespan, and it is unfair to make sweeping generalizations about any particular age group.",
"I dont agree that young people enjoy life more than older people. Enjoyment and happieness doesnt stop at defenite age. It depend on many other factors which are more important than the age. It is not nescessary that young people enjoy their lives more than the older people for many reasons.
       We can find many old people who enjoy thier lives by different ways for example, if we will see the travellers to any country, we can find that lots of travellers rare not young people . On other hand, there are many young people who dont enjoy their lives as old people. So enjoyment mainly depends on the person himself so if he/ she someone who like to enjoy his life and has many interesting things to do in his/ her life, nothing can prevent that to occurs even if the person was old. Some old people live their lives as young people and some young people live thier lives as old people for example, there are some youngs who dont enjoy thier times and dont like advantures or to try new things they seem to be as complex people. On other hand Some old people they like to enjoy thier lives so they do any thing make them happy so when you meet them you think that you meet young people not old ones !
    Some people think that young people enjoy life more than others because the period of their life is the most exciting time and full of playing and new experiences because young people like to try any thing new but certainly this is wrong opinion because old people also have their methods and ways that make them enjoy their lives for example: marriage, money, travel, friends, ......etc  . 
So the life is Enjoya",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of goods and services, creating an illusion of perfection that rarely aligns with reality. This essay will explore the reasons behind this phenomenon, drawing upon specific examples to illustrate my point. 

One of the primary reasons why advertisements often present an idealized version of products is the inherent nature of marketing. Advertisers aim to capture attention, evoke desire, and ultimately drive sales. To achieve this, they employ a range of techniques, including selective showcasing of features, strategic use of imagery, and persuasive language. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might highlight its sleek design and advanced camera capabilities while conveniently omitting information about its battery life or potential software glitches. This selective presentation creates a distorted perception of the product, making it appear more desirable than it truly is. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, advertisers can create a positive association with their products, even if the product itself is not inherently exceptional. Consider a commercial for a luxury car that features a family enjoying a scenic road trip. This emotional connection, while appealing, may overshadow the car's actual performance or practicality. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately reflect the qualities of products, the vast majority tend to exaggerate their benefits and create an idealized image that rarely matches reality. The inherent nature of marketing, coupled with the use of emotional appeals, contributes to this phenomenon. Consumers must be aware of these tactics and exercise critical thinking when evaluating advertisements to avoid falling prey to unrealistic expectations.",
"Enjoyement in a undefined term, it depends on an individual to define something enjoyable.A humanatarian wont find a wrestling match enjoyable but other may.Ahunter would be delighted after hunting but a wild life protector would be engulfed with pain and agony.Whether something is enjoyable or not is solely at an individuals disrcretion.the situation,state,environment all are responsible for defining whether a particular situation is enjoyable or not.

Young people are supposed to be enjoying there life to the max as they are not restricted by any kind of physical problems. They are fit and a passionate to work and can enjoy the life without any problems.They can do what ever they want to do.They can eat anything they want to, indulge into all kind of activities, and can be careless.They can protect themselves and are independant.This is could be an advantage on the physical front.

On an emotional front they are more strong.They can take tough decison and can venture into risky propositions cause they have ample time to make amends for if something goes wrong.They dont have that much responsibilty and can be more open about there life.
They are carefree and and are seldomly under pressure of something.

The biggest problem that young people face once they are old enough to understand the realities of life are the presuure of making there position in the society,choosing a career and building it up,standing up to the expectation of others and ownself.They have an entire life to plan out and once they have achieved it they can enjoy more then any one. 

Old people can also enjoy there life if they have all the basic necessacities available to them.They dont have to think about there future any more,they can lay back and bask ,wake up ,have a cup of tea,call up there friends and play games or have discussions.

The only problem that they can have is on the medical,thats the only thing that makes old age painful otherwiose if an old man has the basic amenities for his survival and is still indipendant then he is far more happier.He is over with his responsibilities and has no more tension about his future.",
"The knowledges can be defined like the possibilities of everyone to speak on the biggest variety of subjects as possible. So it depends of the childhood, the luck to go to school and more generally of your life. For a student it is a good and a current question to know if he must do choose early a speciality or keep during a long time many differents lectures, What is the better choice ?

It is not be sure that the better choice exist. Nevertheless to my mind the recent evolution permits to think that a broad knowledges is prefered.

The first example which accreditates the thesis of a broad knowledge is better is a farmer lost in a desert area whith his cows he must primary to know how to take care them. It is easy to believe that he do not need to have broad knowledges in an another speciality, but it is a restrictiv wiew. In fact if he wants that his business stays prosperous he needs to know read and write, it permits buy and sail some cows or oter animals. It is a simple example but there is another more technic.

In the future the degree of exigence about knowledges will be increase so much. In fact it is not possible to think that an chemistry engineer who work for an international big company which is carried oil and gas will not able to speak englisk very well. However he spends much of his time to study essentially the chemistry in this diferrents forms. The english have a secondary importance but it is essential for not say vital to find a job.

To conclude the best it is know lot of things in lot of specialities. But it is not easy to be competent in all",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods and services, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them seem much better than they truly are. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the desire to attract consumers and boost sales, often at the expense of providing truthful information. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information and misleading imagery. For example, a commercial for a weight-loss product might feature a model with a toned physique, implying that using the product will guarantee similar results. However, the commercial might fail to mention that the model also follows a strict diet and exercise regimen. This selective presentation creates an unrealistic expectation that the product alone can achieve extraordinary transformations. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and persuasive language to sway consumers. By evoking feelings of desire, excitement, or fear, advertisers can create a sense of urgency and convince viewers that they need a particular product. For instance, a car commercial might showcase a family enjoying a scenic road trip, suggesting that owning the car will bring happiness and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the actual features and functionality of the product. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may present accurate information, the majority tend to exaggerate the qualities of products to entice consumers. The use of selective information, misleading imagery, and emotional appeals creates a distorted perception of reality, leading consumers to believe that products are more effective or desirable than they actually are. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these manipulative tactics and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various initiatives. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change movements, such as Fridays for Future, showcases their dedication to environmental sustainability. These young activists organize protests, raise awareness, and advocate for policy changes, demonstrating their commitment to creating a better future for their communities. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to make a difference. Many young individuals are using their technological expertise to develop innovative solutions for community problems. For example, young programmers are creating apps that connect volunteers with local organizations, while social media influencers are using their platforms to raise funds for charitable causes. These examples highlight the diverse ways in which young people are leveraging their abilities to contribute to their communities. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people, it's important to recognize the numerous ways in which they are actively engaged in community service. From volunteering their time to utilizing their skills, young individuals are making a positive impact on their communities. It's crucial to acknowledge and celebrate their contributions rather than dismissing their efforts as insufficient.",
"I m line wid the idea that young people enjoy their life more then their elders do. Young people beleive that only a healthy mind can dwell in healthy body .Youths  have revolutionised the world of entertainment and serves to be the backbone of entertainment industry.Young people are very energetic and enthusiastic.They do every thing, they undertake ,with extra vigour and keen intrest.Undoubtedly their physical state plays a major role in making them appropriate to enjoy life to its fullest.while ours elders lacks that zeal and enthusuasm beacause of their dotage and senility.
Jack, a graduate student from harvard university, has variety of hobbies ranging from taking part into adventorous river rafting,enrolling for mountain tracking to horese riding.Playing football is his strength and chess being his meditation.He also does yogic exercises while in gymnasium.Moreover indulging himself in sports helps to stay  him fit,active and alert.And this thing had helped him substantially to achieve a sense of contentment  at all the three fronts of his life, be it professional,personal or social.
Youths beleive that Enjoying life could recede stress and pressure from their life.So they go to theatres to watch a latest movie,play various musical instruments,surf the internet to gather the information about latest happenings around the world,go for paraglyding,take part in adventurous sports and many more other sports and medium of entertainment that our elders could not even think of.It has been seen that a boy would be very excited and cheerful about his new bike and would take pleasure in admiring the beauty and latest technology ,the bike has.
On the contrary our elders are burdened because of their social and professional committments.They do not have enough time for relishing and savoring their lifestyle.So they may not enjoy goimg to a movie or a horse riding.They would prefer to live rather a calm an serene life without excitement.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and driving purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the quality of products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements employ persuasive techniques to make products seem far more appealing than they actually are. 

One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is exaggeration. They often use superlatives and hyperbole to emphasize the benefits of their products, making them appear superior to their competitors. For example, a shampoo advertisement might claim to provide “unparalleled shine” or “instant volume,” even though these claims may be subjective and difficult to verify. This exaggeration can mislead consumers into believing that the product will deliver extraordinary results, when in reality, it may only offer modest improvements. 

Furthermore, advertisements often focus on showcasing the product in idealized settings and situations. They may feature attractive models, luxurious environments, and unrealistic scenarios that create a sense of desirability and aspiration. This can lead consumers to associate the product with a certain lifestyle or image, even if it has little to do with the actual product itself. For instance, a car advertisement might depict a sleek vehicle driving through scenic landscapes and bustling city streets, suggesting a sense of freedom and adventure, when in reality, the car may be simply a means of transportation. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can provide information about products, they are primarily designed to persuade consumers to buy. By employing exaggeration, idealized settings, and other persuasive techniques, most advertisements create an inflated perception of products, making them seem much better than they really are. It is important for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",

"I deeply agree to the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they actually are. In fact, I believe that many products would hardly be bought at all if people only knew the product itself and not the advertisement that goes along with it. My opinion on this has been influenced by experience and by academic studies, and I would like to state several reasons for my answer. 
	First of all, the psychological mechanisms behind advertisments are rather obvious. It is easy to see that a galopping horse and a handsome man have not much in common with the taste of a cigarette, but the positive feelings created by the descibed image do influence a persons feelings towards the advertised brand. This can be explained psychologically and physiologically, and I am sure that studying Psychology has helped me understand the underlying principles better. The advertisement industry is a huge and powerful one and the quality of an adverts thoroughly influences the selling numbers of a product. 
	In one lecture on the psychology of advertisements I heard about certain techniques that are employed by advertisers which have only deepened my opinion on advertisements. An example of the fakeness of the presented product is the fact that the thickly streaming milk one can see in an advertisement for cornflakes is as tasteless as the flakes themselves: the milk is actually glue and the flakes are made of plastic.
	I am convinced that most advertising companies employ similar techniques to make the products seem supernatural and generally better than they are. It is unlikely that a company could still compete with others if they simply stated that their product was good. It seems like a good idea to have certain regulations in advertising. These do already exist and it seems almost necessary  to protect consumers from being lured into purchasing a product that only seems attractive because of the idea sold along with it. 
	It makes sense that a producer wants his product to shine in the best light. However, I think that the techniques being used in advertising these days go far beyond what one could call a realistic image of a product. Therefore, I can only agree to the statement given.",
"The human knowledge can be formed by different topics, subjects, expiriences, memories and very important; by many academic subjects. Then, if we are able to broad knoledge of many academic subjects, why to specialize in one specific subject?. On the one hand, when people often specialize only in one specific subject their basic knowledge is, obviously, going to be all about that specific subject. But, in the other hand thos who learn many subjects, and do not focus only in one, in my opinion are the ones who are closer to succes. I am going to support my opinion with two ordinary and essential examples.

	First, in our ordinary lifes we are expose to many different situations and expiriences, which we do not know if those are going to be easy or difficult to handle. For example, an ordinary conversation with your parter can be easy, but if you are talking to your boss you have to be prepared by having the necessary knowledge in a variety of different subjects. For this reason, we have to be prepared and to have all the necessary knowledge to be ready to defend any topic or subject that we are expose. By knowing all the information about only one subject will not help you to escape of a problem if it is based in another subject.

	Second, the fact of wanting to be a good professional gives you chance to work in many different areas. For example, these are can be: bussiness, advertising, laws, and many more. So, if you are specialize only one subject gives you limites. In contrast, if you are well prepared with knowledge of different subjects you are able to establish a conversation in any topic.

	In conclusion, is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, than to specialize in one specific subjest. For the reason that it makes you a prepared person in every way.",
"Even though helping cimmunities gradually becomes a social issue, I still think many young people do not really care about their communities and give enough time to helping their communities. There are some reasons are listed as follows.
     The main reason, nowadays the internet is very popular, and many news report that too many youbg people spend too much time on the internet. Those reports say that the internet is too attractive that causes  young people can not conerntrate on their schooling. If young people can not do their schooling well, how do you think they will give another time to helping their communities.
    Another, young people are hard to concern what other pople need at the ages. Young people always care about what is cool and wnat to be special. Especially, nowadays culture will lead the stituation become sever. The movies and music are always looking for astonishing and cool things, and do not really care about the social issues. Young people are the mostly effected ages. They may be controlled by nowadays fashion culture and they do not know.
     In short, there are more and more attractive things that young people can do and the circustance doesn't show the correct perspective, how can you think these young people will give enough time to their communities.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and prepares individuals for a rapidly evolving world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base cultivates intellectual curiosity. Exposure to diverse subjects sparks a thirst for understanding and encourages individuals to explore new ideas. For instance, studying history alongside literature can provide a richer context for understanding literary works, while exploring science alongside philosophy can lead to insightful reflections on the nature of reality. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a lifelong love of learning and a desire to constantly expand one's horizons.
Secondly, a broad knowledge base enhances critical thinking skills. By engaging with multiple perspectives and disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from different angles, identify biases, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking is essential in today's complex world, where individuals are bombarded with information from various sources.
Finally, a broad knowledge base prepares individuals for a rapidly evolving world. In an era of technological advancements and shifting career landscapes, adaptability is crucial. A broad foundation in various subjects equips individuals with the flexibility to navigate new challenges and embrace emerging opportunities. For example, a student with a broad understanding of technology, business, and communication may be better equipped to adapt to the changing demands of the workforce than someone with a narrow specialization.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and prepares individuals for a dynamic world. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, we can cultivate well-rounded individuals who are intellectually curious, adaptable, and equipped to thrive in the 21st century.",

"We all know the common advertisements in the media. No matter if they appear in television, in magazines or in the radio. Do hamburgers really look so much bigger and so much more delicious in the TV? In my opinion, they definately do.
In the different marketing lessons I took part in, I've learned that this effect is a widespread marketing tool to sell more products and according to this a bigger profit. The marketing bureaus of big companies are working hand in hand with designers to make their product looking the best it is able to.
Let us have a little review about the example with the burgers. In the advertisements the burgers and french fries look so incredibly delicious that you might have a bite directly from your TV. Furthermore they even seem to be very huge. But when you step in an fast food restaurant you will face the truth. The burgers taste awful and in addition to that you will, still hungry, leave the restaurant unsatisfied. 
There are plenty more examples than only the look of a product. For instance, most people think that the cars of Daimler Chrysler settle the leadership in safety. By using the only good results out of some safety tests, Daimlers marketing bureau implements the reliability of their cars. But the real leader, when it comes to safety, is Toyota. So, when the first problems with your air-bags occure, you might recognize the truth.
The quality of some clothes gives us another example. Regarding the very popular clothes company H&M, you know what their type of advertising is! In their ads they tell you that you get their clothes which so trendy and fashionable for an extremely low price. But you might get to know why this piece of fashion is so cheap when you put it the first time out of your washing machine. The colours have been bleached and they won't fit anymore.
To sum up, I really have the opinion that the most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are.",
"Knowledge is the base of what we have. It is the thing that remain with us all over the years. Knowledge is what make a person special from others.
Some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. This broad knowledge can help you anytime and you will not have to depend on others in every single thing out of your specialize subject and it will make you a well-known person who has an experience in everything you want to learn about.
Others think that being specialize in one specific subject is better than have board knowledge because it can help to be better in your subject. It allow you to be the best and the person who can depend on in that subject.
I agree with people who think it is better to have broad knowledge and I prefer to have it rather than a person with a limit knowledge. For examble, when two persons go to a company and ask for a job one with a board knowledge and the other whith a limit knowledge I think they will choose the first person because he can be more helpfull. I am a person who believe in benig special in all the subject you love so I will agree with the first arguement for sure.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods and services, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them seem far superior to their actual capabilities. This tendency to embellish reality stems from the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to purchase. 

One compelling example of this exaggeration is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing in beauty advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve flawless skin, perfect proportions, and unrealistic beauty standards. This manipulation creates an unattainable ideal that can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction among consumers. Similarly, food advertisements often use techniques like close-ups and selective lighting to make food appear more appealing than it truly is. The vibrant colors and exaggerated textures entice consumers, but the actual product may fall short of these unrealistic expectations. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ persuasive language and emotional appeals to create a sense of urgency or desirability. They may highlight the supposed benefits of a product without providing concrete evidence or focusing on its limitations. For instance, a weight loss advertisement might promise rapid and effortless weight loss, while neglecting to mention the potential side effects or the need for consistent effort. This manipulative approach can mislead consumers into making impulsive purchases that they may later regret. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can provide valuable information about products, it is crucial to recognize that they are primarily designed to persuade. The use of exaggeration, manipulation, and emotional appeals often creates a distorted perception of reality, making products seem much better than they truly are. As consumers, we must be aware of these tactics and exercise critical thinking when evaluating advertising messages.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, both young and old individuals can experience profound joy and fulfillment in their respective stages of life.
One key difference between young and older people is their perspective on time. Young people often feel an abundance of time, allowing them to explore new experiences and pursue their passions with less pressure. This sense of freedom can lead to a heightened sense of enjoyment. However, older individuals, having lived through a wider range of experiences, may appreciate the present moment more deeply. They have learned to savor the simple pleasures and find joy in the company of loved ones.
Furthermore, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances and priorities. A young person may find immense satisfaction in pursuing a career or traveling the world, while an older person may derive greater fulfillment from raising a family or contributing to their community. Ultimately, the level of enjoyment is not determined by age but by the individual's ability to find meaning and purpose in their life.
In conclusion, while young people may experience a certain level of carefree enjoyment, it is not necessarily indicative of a greater capacity for happiness than older individuals. Both young and old can find joy and fulfillment in their respective stages of life, and the key to a fulfilling life lies in finding meaning and purpose regardless of age.",
"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people because I think that the definition of ""enjoying life"" is very subjective and changes during life.
At first let me talk about the subjectiveness of enjoying life. There are so many different kinds of people all over the world. Enjoying life can mean to have a great job and a carrier rising up. But there are also people who think that nobody can enjoy life while working. Another example are children. On the one hand there are couples who never want to have children, on the other hand a family can consist of the parents and five children and everybody is glad to live within such a big family. What I wanted to say is, that enjoying life cannot be putted into a definition to test out if somebody is enjoying his or her life because it matches this definition.
Another point is, that certain feelings or activities which could be defined as part of a joyful life, change during life. Young people who are going to school or university like parties and dancing and most of them doing a lot of sports. They have hobbies and activities they are participating in and friends they meet with. These things help them to enjoy their lifes. Older people for example between seventy and eighty years enjoy their lifes in a different way. They are glad if everybody is healthy, they maybe like watching television and drinking a glass of wine in the evening. 
What I wanted to point out is that people enjoy their lifes in many different way. What way it is depends on their personality and their age. 
That is why I disagree with the statement. I do not think that young people are happier than older ones. They are only enjoying life in a different way.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complex and nuanced nature of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance and a sense of limitless possibility, it is a mistake to assume that this equates to a greater enjoyment of life. In fact, older individuals often possess a deeper appreciation for life's simple pleasures and have the wisdom to navigate its challenges with greater resilience. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can detract from their enjoyment of life. The pursuit of education, career aspirations, and social acceptance can create a constant sense of urgency and stress.
For example, a young person may be overwhelmed by the pressure to succeed academically, which can lead to sleepless nights and feelings of inadequacy. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a greater sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to savor the present moment without the same level of pressure. 

Secondly, older people have had the opportunity to accumulate a wealth of experiences and perspectives that can enhance their enjoyment of life. Through years of living, they have learned to appreciate the beauty in the ordinary, to value relationships, and to find meaning in their contributions to the world. For instance, a retired teacher may find immense satisfaction in volunteering at a local library, sharing their love of literature with young minds. This sense of purpose and fulfillment can contribute significantly to their overall enjoyment of life. 

In conclusion, while youth may offer a certain carefree energy, it is not accurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. The enjoyment of life is a complex and subjective experience that evolves throughout our lives. Older individuals often possess a deeper appreciation for life's simple pleasures, a greater sense of stability, and a wealth of experiences that contribute to their overall well-being.",
"The topic state that ""It is better to have knowledge of a number of academic subjects than having specialization in one specific subjects"" and I tend to disagree. The reason for taking this stand is this -although education systems through out the globe support both the modes of study yet a specialist is any ways prefered over a person who is a kind of ""jack of all trades"".

Before going into depth let me remind you about a normal prcedure of education these days. When a child goes to school then in order to make him acquainted with all things in the surrounding, he is tought a variety of subjects. Later on, in his teens, he is taught the basic of all the major streams, so that he can choose his major. Finally, this all goes in the direction of choosing one subject, and all the subjects are touched so that he can find out the flow of his interests. 

Now lets talk about ""Specialization"". The specialzation is required for depth knowledge of a subject. To work over a subject you always need that and all the subjects (available for major) are having enough depth to spend your life working on it. 

I remember one very well said line ""Practice makes a man perfect"".  In the same way a specialists is always having his concentration at a subject and is working out with that subject all the time in order to get best results for the well-fare of the society.

Here, I can also take example of myself. What would I do in case I get a heart problem? I would definetly go to a heart specialist. The similar situation can be applied in all the problems you encounter in your life.

Its true a basic knowledge of each and every subject is required to sustain your life without getting stucked at every other hurdle that comes but broad knowledge of many academic subjects will make life a mess. You would not be able to comentrate on one thing. 

Hence, I would always prefer going for a specialization instead of mugging my head in a number of subjects at a time.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it is true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits over communal involvement, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that the statement is inaccurate, highlighting the numerous ways young people actively contribute to society. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change activism demonstrates their commitment to protecting the environment. These young individuals organize protests, raise awareness, and advocate for sustainable policies, showcasing their dedication to creating a better future for their communities. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to make a difference. Many young entrepreneurs are launching businesses that create jobs and contribute to the local economy. Others are using their artistic abilities to engage their communities through music, art, and literature. These creative endeavors not only enrich the cultural fabric of society but also foster a sense of belonging and shared identity. 

Finally, young people are actively using technology to connect with and support their communities. Social media platforms have become powerful tools for mobilizing resources, raising awareness, and facilitating collective action. Young people are using these platforms to organize fundraisers, promote local businesses, and connect with individuals in need. This digital engagement demonstrates their willingness to utilize modern tools to address community challenges.

In conclusion, while some young people may not be actively involved in traditional forms of community service, it is inaccurate to claim that they are not contributing. From volunteering to entrepreneurship and digital activism, young people are actively shaping their communities in diverse and meaningful ways. It is essential to acknowledge their efforts and encourage their continued engagement in building a better future for all.",
"The issue at the hand is whether the advertisements make products much better than really are.This issue is very important because advertisement has become important part in everybody life.I agree with the statement because  they attract people to spend money whcih is offf no use.

The first reason , advertisements are one way of communicating the inforamtion about a product .Advertisements convey information about the product in a way to attract people by infering the false information.As a result the people who watched the advertisement tend to buy the product and comes to know it's of no use after spending a plenty of money on it.It may not affect the rich people but the middle class people would have spend this money on some other useful purpose.

Second reason , advertisements are important attraction to the people of different ages.So people try to imitate the actions seens in the advertisements which affects person performing it and also  their family who depend upon him/her.This is happening because the advertisements gives only the advantage of it than explaining the disadvantages.


Finally the companies advertise for increase their buisiness than thinking of the people.For example most of the  drinks like soda: are harmful to the people health in many ways due to toxic present in them.But they advertise these products with famous film actress or actor which attracts the people to buy the soda.So in this way advertisements will not convey the complete information about the product to the society.If the advertisements infers the complete information about theproduct the sales of it will decrease which will effects the company profit.Now- a- days  drinking of soda became a adiction to most of the people .



In conclusion  i think commercials will not convey the complete and better information because to gain profits .",
"I partialy agree with the following statement young people enjoy life more than older people do.
                 
                 young people often enjoy life more because the young people doesnot have much responsibilities  as loking to their families as the older people have. These young enjoy with there friends by  going out, like as movies,excersions and many more.
                  The older people even enjoy their life as the young people do. They   also meet their friends play cards with them, have a chat with them,talk about their young age life, discuss about their family and so on.The older people also have more responsibilities towards their family.
                    The young people enjoy riding  their bikes with  the maximum speed on the roads. where as the older people cannot sit and  ride the bike like the young people do but they enjoy by  sitting  home  infront of the television and watch movies or any comedy shows. For enjoyment there should not be any age.we can enjoy irrespective of age group.

                    There  is one such situation the older people enjoy more than the young do, that is at the  exams time ,they have to workhard to prepare for an exam.some people enjoy reading but some doesnot.
                  
                    The old people memorize their young age and enjoy sharing with other  friends  by telling that "" I have jumped out from the hostel to watch the mid night show but unfortunately my warden cought me and punished"" . 
                    
                   There will be lot of responsibilities to the older people even then they enjoy alot as the young people do. by enjoying they can lost there tensions and be happy in the future life.
                   
                    I finally conclude  that the young  people and the old people equally enjoy the life.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, a significant number actively engage in community service and make a positive impact.

One reason for this misconception is the focus on traditional forms of community involvement, such as volunteering at soup kitchens or participating in local charity events. However, young people are increasingly finding innovative ways to contribute. For instance, many use their online platforms to raise awareness for social causes, organize online campaigns, or donate to charities through digital platforms. This digital activism allows them to reach a wider audience and mobilize support for important issues.
Furthermore, young people are often at the forefront of social change movements. They are passionate about environmental sustainability, social justice, and human rights. They organize protests, participate in marches, and advocate for policies that benefit their communities. Their energy and idealism are driving forces behind many positive changes in society.
In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people's involvement in their communities, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute. From traditional volunteering to online activism and social change movements, young people are actively shaping their communities and making a difference. To truly understand their impact, we need to look beyond traditional definitions of community service and acknowledge the multifaceted ways in which they are engaged.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a simplistic and inaccurate view. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly across individuals.
A young person might find immense joy in exploring new experiences and pushing boundaries, while an older person might derive satisfaction from the stability and wisdom gained through years of living.
For example, a young artist might revel in the creative freedom of experimentation, while a seasoned artist might find fulfillment in the mastery of their craft.
Secondly, the challenges and responsibilities of life can be equally rewarding for both young and old.
Young people may face the pressure of academic pursuits and career choices, but they also have the opportunity to shape their future and discover their passions.
Older people, on the other hand, may grapple with health issues and financial concerns, but they also have the chance to nurture relationships, pursue hobbies, and contribute to their communities. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not determined by age but by individual perspective and the ability to find meaning and purpose in one's experiences.
Both young and old have the potential to live fulfilling lives, and it is unfair to suggest that one group inherently enjoys life more than the other.",
"most advertisements are making the product much desirable.i am agree with this idea.i have some couple reasons and examples.first of all we should think about this on this age. people have economical or financial problems and they do not think about to buy something new and if this people do not show any action the reproduction in the country can stop for a while and it can cause so many problems like trading.before all this happens workers in reproduction thinks about how to sell their new product.let's say for this a new kind of flavour of a hershey's chocolate.if this product do not have a good advertisement nobody would eat it.my secaond reason for this subject is advertisement gives to the product a new form. if i should tell it in more details i would say this attractivity.this is really important the reason why is that people if they do not desire something they do not want to get it.my third reason is when a product shows on the television or on the billboards it is taking more attention.for example coca cola's advertisement, when it is a really a hot weather at outside we want to drink something really cold which can take our dehydrate so what we are thinking to buy? immediatley a coke because at this time at least we have been seen the coke's advertisement. what we understand about this situation, coke's firm could not be so productible and famous without advertisements.this reduce also my last reason: advertisement makes the product more famous. people can know about the new products by the advertisement and this make product much better it is again.
my final words will be about this subject, without advertisements, products can not exist and have not the light to be selled.",
"For the last decades society has been suffering the opposite way of ""humanities"" conducts that were lived specifically in the 16th and 17th centuries, where people cared for others, for humanity, that's why was created the ""Humanism"". The actual problem is the specialization of subjects that cut off the human relationships. Instead of care by the person who lives close to us, we care more to know the reason of the molecular existance, for example. What I want to say is that in the way we obtain more broad knowledge of academic and cultural subjects, we could be better persons in society because we'll understand those who are the same as us and we also be capable to understand the problems we have as society. It is part of an open-minded education that the study of a specific subject couldn't bring. To preserve peaceful relationships between different cultures, nations and between different personalities, as society we should perform educational curriculums that waranty a broad knowledge education.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that overlooks the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, many actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of responsibility and compassion. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives. From organizing environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice, young people are using their energy and creativity to address pressing issues. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, showcases their commitment to making a difference. They are not simply passive recipients of community service; they are actively shaping it.
Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time in various capacities. They mentor children, support the elderly, and assist in local organizations. These acts of service often go unnoticed, but they contribute significantly to the well-being of their communities. The dedication of these young volunteers demonstrates their willingness to give back and make a positive impact.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From leading initiatives to volunteering their time, young people are actively engaged in making a difference. Their commitment to service, though often understated, is a testament to their compassion and desire to create a better world.",
"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do. Both these are the stages of life and people enjoy at every stage. But, I feel that people get more enjoyment at old age.

In young stage, people strive to earn their lives for themselves, for their children and for their parents. They always work and work to earn more money , more status etc to earn living at that point of time and to save money or invest money for later part of life, which is older age. Real enjoyment starts when they use the money earned for enjoyment as they are having more free time for enjoyment. 

Secondly, old age is the last stage of life when people have seen all the wordly pleasure of life during their various stages of life. But, in my viewpoint, people gets more satisfaction when they are with complete family including their grand children. That is the stage when people feel more enjoyment to be with. People earn money for getting this phase of life with good times. 

Thirdly, I feel that in old age, people can do any work according to their liking because they are under no pressure to earn their life. But, in young age, people remains under pressure to fulfill their dreams and always running after life. In old age, life comes to a stand still and people enjoy the fruits of the trees what they have planted in young age. Because of this reason, old age people gets more satisfaction during that time as compared to young age.

Lastly, in old age, people gets more respect in the society which in turn gives more enjoyment towards life. People at this stage can indulge in activities like temple work, which helps them in soothing their soul. Beyond this there is no enjoyment on earth which humans can get. 

I would like to retierate that people enjoy more in old age as compared to young age.",
"There are a lot of advertisments in society, and I often see them. I like seeing them, so I agree with the follwing statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are. I have some reasons.
	First of all, it is often possible for most advertisments to make products seem much better than they really are because they often have a lot of coments and pictures. For example, a lot of advertisements have many user's coments, and they also have a lot of pictures. The a lot of coments and pictures influence on readers. If advertisement has nice coments and pictures, the goods is bought by a lot of people.   
	Second, the advertisements having a lot of pictures and coments can make reader happy. For example, if you see advertisements which do not have advertisements, you maybe think the advertisements is very boring. But, most advertisements have a lot of pictures and coments, so you can enjoy seeing the advertisements. Therefore, you feel that most advertisements is very good, even if the advertisements is not better than they really are.
	For these reasons, I think that I disagree with the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.",
"As to which it is better, taking a number of academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject, the answer depends on a student's personal development. To tesify it, we should look into both of the position.

For one thing, as a undergraduate student, you are supposed to take multitude of academic subjects. This does be benifical for you. To begin with, while taking various subjects, students exploit their ability, and find out what they really interest in. Take my own experience for example, thanks to our university's education system, I needn't to choose my subject as a freshman. In the first two years,  I took every classes attacting me. Therefore, when I am junior now, I exactly know what subject is my love. In contrast, my best friend Yu wasn't as lucky as me. Indeed, she is regreting to choose history every minute nowadays. Therefore, it is too haste to specialize in a pecular in undergratude schools. Moreover, having a great many of academic subjects not only helps develop a databse for a student, but also helps a student to make friends and build his/her personal social relasionships.

At the some time, if you are a graduate student, unquestionably,  you ought to specialize in one specific subject. Because once a student decides to have further study, which means he/she already has a well-defined purpose, he/she are advisable to choose the career for all life. And nnly when studying in a graduate school, does a student concentrate on a subject. Subsequently, a student are supposed to engross in the research and have outcome from it. Furthermore, most of companies require applicants who are proficient on a special fields. If the applicants has the expertise, the corporation will pay high salary for it. 

As you can see from the above-mentioned text, the answer to the statement varies. There are circumstances where requires expertise, while there are other circumstances where broader knowledge is splendid. Thus, I both agree and disagree with the statement.",
"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than old people do for many reasons. A young person can do a lot of thing because he is physically halthy, can do a lot that old's can not do and because he is young and no one will look at what is he donig.
   A lot  of people think that old people are enjoy the life more than young because they think they have experiance in life. They think that this experiance will make them happy because they no what to do to be a happy person. This may not be a good idea because even if old people have an experiance they will not be able to use this experiance. They become old and harmfull. They will not be able to do every thing.
   As a young person I can do a lot of things. there are many hapits to do in the daily life. A young person can go running, play football, drive a race care and play a young people new electronic games. This will be hard to old person to do or it may be don't fit to an old person to do like electronic games.
   For most young people they like to do hard or dangeruce activities. Driving a race car in a real race can be very dangeruce for an old person he may get a hard attack. Other thing that is young people can make a plannes for the fucure, they have the time that olds don't have.
   Finally, a young person can enjoy life more than old can do. He have the ability, the advantege and the time. For all old people they must have taken a young period and enjoy it. So that it is time for the new generation.",
"Nowadays, advertisement is a world-wide phenomenon that tends to pry even in our privacy. In my opinion, it seems obvious that most advertisements try to make products appear better than they really are.
	To begin with, we must not forget that business is business. Then, no matter how despicable the means are, the sole purpose is to make money. That is why ads always bludgeon the would-be customer into buying something. To do so, ads are expected to attract people 's attention at all costs.
	Moreover, advertisements often convey the picture of an ideal and perfect world. For instance, as far as the clothing industry is concerned, we all have seen ads showing sculptural bodies wearing marvellous garments! Unfortunately, the average citizen does not look like the models so he or she feels quite frustrated. Giving a product a better appearance than its real one turns out to be an unwholesome way to convince the customer to buy something.
	To a certain extent, this phenomenon is linked to the kind of brainwashing people experience under totalitarian regimes, namely it tries to put everyone ine the same single mold without taking care of individuals. You have to be careful if you do not want to be influenced and this requires a great amount of self-control. One solution could lie in education : we should teach children how to have their own opinions in spite of what is shown to them. This could probably prevent such dangerous drifts (if this kind of advertising was not so efficient it would have certainly been abandoned !).

Thus, we may affirm that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. By no means must we forget that the main purpose is to make profit so we would rather try not to be influenced. I think that it could be much better if enough safety nets were established but you know : every law has a loophole !",
"In the bustling world of consumerism, advertisements play a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods and services, I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the qualities of products, making them seem far more desirable than they truly are. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to purchase. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They often highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight loss supplement might showcase individuals with dramatic transformations, but fail to mention the potential side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise. This selective presentation creates an illusion of effortless results, enticing consumers to believe that the product is a magical solution. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently utilize persuasive language and imagery to evoke emotional responses. By associating products with feelings of happiness, success, or belonging, advertisers aim to create a sense of desire and need. For example, a car commercial might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that owning the car will bring them joy and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on feelings rather than rational considerations. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may offer accurate information, the majority tend to present an idealized and often misleading picture of products. By selectively highlighting positive attributes, employing persuasive language, and evoking emotional responses, advertisers aim to create a sense of desirability and urgency that can lead consumers to make uninformed decisions. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization offers profound expertise in a specific field, I firmly believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters a well-rounded individual with a greater capacity for critical thinking, adaptability, and innovation.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to connect ideas and solve problems from diverse perspectives. For instance, a historian with a grasp of economics can better understand the social and economic factors that shaped historical events. Similarly, a scientist with a background in literature can communicate complex scientific concepts more effectively. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more holistic understanding of the world and its complexities.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals who can navigate diverse challenges and learn new skills quickly. A person with a broad knowledge base is better equipped to adapt to new situations and embrace new opportunities. For example, a graduate with a degree in philosophy may find themselves well-suited for careers in fields like law, business, or even technology, thanks to their strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more enriching and adaptable educational experience. It fosters critical thinking, interdisciplinary understanding, and adaptability, preparing individuals to thrive in a complex and ever-evolving world. By embracing a diverse range of academic subjects, we cultivate a more well-rounded and intellectually stimulating learning journey.",
"Young People and Communities

	In our developing world many things being changed. Nowadays, young people do not spend their time for their comminications. I agree, that young people do not give enough time for the communities. I beleive that young people has some reasons for to not have enough time for communities.


	First of all, our world changing everday.Nowadays people need money to stay alive so it is sometimes hard to spend time to helping communities. Being a human brings more resposilities and hard work. Some young people working in part time job they do not only earn money but also they earn experience. For instance; I do not hate to spend time for my community on the contrary i love it. In fact, I am working in my business and studying in university so I do not have enough time for my community. World getting harder and harder each day to stay alive thats why young people spendign their time mostly to earn money.  

	Secondly, there is other reason which is effective on young people to not have time for comminity. In our world technology developes by day and day. After internet has been dicovered young people gets worse and worse cause of it pushes person to lonely life. I accept that internet makes our life easier while we loose our young generation to spend more time on internet instead of our communities.For example; I prefer to stay at home and surf on internet rather that to spend time in my community. 

	In conclusion, I think, that young people have reasons to not spend their time in communties. I belive that young people will have more time to spend their time to helping their communities in the future.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are transformed into objects of desire. While some advertisements strive for honesty and transparency, many, in my opinion, fall into the trap of exaggeration, making products seem far more appealing than they truly are. This tendency to embellish reality is a pervasive practice in the advertising industry, and it is driven by the desire to capture consumers' attention and drive sales. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might feature a slim and happy individual who achieved remarkable results, while failing to mention the potential side effects or the fact that the product's effectiveness may vary from person to person. This selective presentation creates an unrealistic expectation, leading consumers to believe that the product will magically solve their problems. 

Furthermore, advertisers often rely on visual manipulation and emotional appeals to enhance the desirability of their products. Images are carefully crafted to portray a lifestyle of luxury, success, and happiness, associating these qualities with the product being advertised. This technique plays on our subconscious desires and aspirations, making us believe that owning the product will bring us closer to achieving these ideals. However, the reality is that the product itself is unlikely to deliver on these promises. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be honest and informative, many resort to exaggeration and manipulation to make products appear more appealing than they actually are. By selectively presenting information, using visual trickery, and appealing to our emotions, advertisers create a distorted perception of reality, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based on unrealistic expectations.

"I think to be specialised in one specific subject is good, but is not enough for your personnal development.
	First of all, I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is better to improve your communication with people. I mean, if your knowledge is really broad,you will certainly be able to talk about a lot of differents subjects with a lot of different people. Being open minded in your knowledge leads you, most of the time, of being open minded socially. It is important to be interested in several things, that shows your ability to adapt yourself to different situations, and i do believe that being able to adapt yourself to a given situation is always a good point; whatever you actually want to do in life.
	Furthermore, the more you learn, the more you want to learn (and need to learn actually). The wilingness to learn can be found if  you are specializing in one specific subject, but a single subject may leads  you to isolate youself in technical considerations that non one can actually understand, whereas plurality of subject makes your mind breath. It is no longer a question of  'academic"" knowledge, it is a question of curiosity. According to me, acknowlegment goes the same way as it goes for food, that is to say if you eat the same food everyday, you will just be quickly disgusted. Therefore, if you just study one single subject, even if you go deeply through it, you will be disgusted one day somewhat.
	To summarize, I rekon it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because you can thus talk about more things, and it makes you so much curious as if you were majoring in one specific subject. I agree to say that learning about a specific subject is a good think, because everything can not be superficial in your life, but if you have only that in your life, that not enough to make this one fun",
"Young people and older people enjoy their life in different ways.
Some people think that young people enjoy life more than adults, however other people think the opposite. I will discuss both points of views and finally give my opinion. 

Young people enjoy their life in several ways.
Children have fun playing with their toys, they can spend hours playing with them and they do not get bored.
Teenagers like to go out with their friends and also to go to parties.
For example, as a teenager I like to go to the beach with my friends and go to discos and pubs.
Young people also enjoy life when they reach a goal.
For instance, I felt really happy when I won the first place with my friends in a rugby competition.
Children also enjoy and feel happy when they know someone protects them and give them love.

Older people have fun and enjoy life in many ways.
Adults feel happy when they reach a goal or they get something important.
For example, when my father was hired in a very good company in my country he was really glad and I noticed he was enjoying it.
Other way to have fun is travelling, most adults like to travel and meet other people.
For instance, my mother is a person who likes to travel a lot and I always go with her, I enjoy it too but I know thats the way my mother enjoys her life.
Something that is very common is that adults lay on their beds and watch television and they seem to enjoy it, even though some people find it boring.

In conclusion, I think that younger people enjoys life more because there are more moments of happiness while they are children and teenagers. They have fun in easier ways than older people. Therefore, in my point of view, children and teenagers enjoy more their life.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products and services. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them appear far superior to their actual capabilities. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to purchase. 

One compelling example of this exaggeration is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing in beauty advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve flawless skin, perfect proportions, and unrealistic features. This manipulation creates an unattainable standard of beauty, leading consumers to believe that the advertised products can transform them into idealized versions of themselves. In reality, these products may only offer minimal improvements, leaving consumers feeling disappointed and disillusioned. 

Furthermore, advertisements often employ deceptive language and imagery to create a false sense of urgency or exclusivity. Phrases like ""limited-time offer"" or ""exclusive access"" are designed to trigger a fear of missing out, prompting consumers to make impulsive purchases. The reality, however, is that these offers may be routinely repeated or available to a wider audience. This manipulative tactic exploits consumers' emotions to drive sales, regardless of the actual value of the product. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately depict product features, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits to entice consumers. The use of airbrushing, deceptive language, and manipulative tactics creates a distorted perception of reality, leading consumers to believe that products are more effective than they truly are. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these advertising strategies and to critically evaluate the claims made before making purchasing decisions.",
"I think older people can also enjoy like young people enjoy. so i am totally disagree with that young people enjoy their life more then that older people . its not mandatory for old people to live their life as young people do . they can live their life in their own way to make it beautiful .its totally depend on people to people.

     Firstally i want to say that older people can do any thing like young people like if they want to go for a party they can go .if they want to do dance in party they can do. i had seen one old person in someones party . these old age person dance like young ones. he was so active.

  secondly , if young people thought that they are active than old person . so they are wrong .old person can do anything like marathon etc. it shows that they can work like young people they can do anything which young people cant 

  thirdly its impoosible to say that young people are more enjoy because young people always take decision instantly which will be not beneficial to them because by doing that can put themslves in danger but for the case of old people they take their their decision after thinking very deeply. take the example of our poltician they are totally old and take decision very politely which makes them happy.

   so i believe that old peolpe can also enjoy like young people not in the same manner just like young one do but in different manner so its ridiculos to say that young can enjoy the life more than that old people.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives addressing social issues. From organizing environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice causes, young people are using their energy and creativity to make a difference. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their commitment to creating a better future.

Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time and skills to support local organizations. They contribute to food banks, mentor underprivileged children, and participate in community events, demonstrating a genuine desire to give back. These actions, often undertaken without recognition or reward, highlight the dedication and compassion that exists among young people.
While it's easy to focus on the perceived apathy of some, it's crucial to recognize the widespread commitment of young people to their communities. Their contributions, whether through activism, volunteering, or simply being good neighbors, are invaluable and deserve recognition. It's important to encourage and support these efforts, fostering a culture of civic engagement among all generations.",
"To answer to this question, i think we have to begin explaining what we think about #many academic subjects# and about #specific subject#. For example, does #many academic subjects# refers to science and econonic, or do we have to understand  mathematic and physic, which are a part of science, or nuclear and light, which are a part of physic.
The conclusion of this example is that there are different degrees of specialization and that we must answer wich one is the best.

If you have a passion in a specifict subject, you ought to specialize in it and to do only that. However, it is interresting to discover many different subjects. Besides, people dislike to do always the same thing. These things depend of each person.

But there is a thing we cannot dennied. The more science knowledge increases in each subject, the more it is difficult to be good in a lot of these one, as the great scientists of the last century. Today each job requires such a good qualification in a specific subject that it is impossible to be good enought in one another totaly different. In an other hand, in jobs like ingeeners, you often have to change the subject in which you work in, and this is i;possible if you are to much specialized. Anyway, in France you have to learn a lot of thing about different subject before being allowed to specialized.

In France, the most specialized ingeeners work alone and the others together. Because i want to work in a team, i will not be as specialed as them.",
"I think that this is not a very simple question. Especially not for me because I am still young and not yet old. So I have only the opportunity to summerize out of my sight as a young man. Nevertheless, I will try to find a well argued result. 

Young people on the one hand are in common healthy. They have the physical possibilty to jump around, dance, make sports, or to move from one point to another. And all that without any disabbilities or any pain. Older people on the other hand have often painful times. Does not matter, if owing to a life's work, or common diseases. They are often not able to walk for a long time. They often have problems with their heart or their blood circulation. But as they worked for nearly their whole life, older people have gotten the possibilty to save some money. Young people did not yet had this opportunity. And nowadays money is an important factor to enjoy one's life. As a result of this let me say that old people are rich and young people poor. Another result of this fact is that older people do not have to work anymore. So they have the opportunity to schedule their time as they want to. Young people on the other side have to go to school, to university, or even to work. Now let me say that time is also a very important factor in our current time. 2:1 for the older people. 

And now let me summerize. Young people are healthy. But they  have neither money nor time to spend in life. For me time and money is the most important to have fun, i. e. to enjoy my life. All these regardings let me think that older people enjoy their life more than young people do.",
"I disagree with this statement to some extent.Young people are more enthusiastic for doing such type of work than the older ones since the latter have a family and also concentrate on their careers to support their family wher as young peole are at the start of their careers and they have less pressure.You can also take the example of many universities having community service as their course.in these  courses although there are no grades they provide great pleasure for younger people to go outside the university and help a community . Also  young people should not be expected of only doing community service since they have an important decisions to make regarding their career.
           One such experience  to support the statement i have made is occured on the date which is celebrated as mahatma gandhi's birthday.On that day many of my colleagues at a local call center and many other  software professionals  participated in helping out to clean  a community   nearby which is full of slums . the reward which we got for it is a great deal of happiness .From then on we helped out that community on saturdays of every week by conducting calsses on health and hygiene and even conducte the classes for elders who dont know how to read and write.For me this is a
perfect example to show that younger generations can do such stuff in modern times too.You can also take the example crisis situations like during war time .Here young ones are the first to take responsibility in providing any kind of support  the army or even helping out the injured. 
                 In summary people should not judge young people on just observing some section who are not that great at community work and also this judgemen",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has been debated for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts across different disciplines. For example, a student with a strong foundation in history, literature, and philosophy can better understand the complexities of social and political issues. They can analyze historical events through the lens of literature and philosophy, gaining a deeper understanding of human behavior and motivations. This interdisciplinary approach fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential in today's interconnected world. 

Furthermore, a broad education prepares individuals for a rapidly changing job market. In an era of technological advancements and evolving industries, adaptability is crucial. Individuals with a diverse range of knowledge are better equipped to navigate new challenges and embrace new opportunities. They can readily transfer their skills and knowledge to different fields, making them more versatile and valuable employees. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches our lives beyond the professional realm. It allows us to engage in meaningful conversations, appreciate different forms of art and culture, and develop a more nuanced understanding of the world around us. By exploring various subjects, we broaden our perspectives, challenge our assumptions, and become more well-rounded individuals. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and adaptable approach to learning. It fosters intellectual curiosity, prepares individuals for a changing world, and enriches our lives in countless ways. By embracing a diverse range of knowledge, we become more informed, adaptable, and engaged citizens of the world.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating one, filled with promises of happiness, success, and fulfillment. However, the question arises: do these advertisements accurately portray the products they promote, or do they embellish reality to lure consumers? I firmly believe that most advertisements, in their pursuit of captivating audiences, tend to exaggerate the benefits of products, creating an illusion of perfection that rarely matches reality. 

One of the most prevalent tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective presentation. They showcase the most appealing aspects of a product while strategically omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss supplement might feature a slim, toned individual, implying that the product guarantees similar results. However, the reality is that such supplements often require a strict diet and exercise regimen to be effective, a fact conveniently left unmentioned. This selective presentation creates a misleading perception of the product's efficacy. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to sway consumers. They evoke feelings of desire, envy, or insecurity, making viewers believe that purchasing a particular product will solve their problems or enhance their lives. A perfume advertisement, for example, might depict a woman surrounded by admirers, suggesting that wearing the fragrance will make her irresistible. This emotional manipulation creates an unrealistic expectation that the product will transform one's life, which is rarely the case. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative and entertaining, they often present a distorted view of reality. By selectively showcasing products and appealing to emotions, they create an illusion of perfection that rarely aligns with the actual experience of using the product. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be discerning and to recognize that advertisements are designed to sell, not to provide an objective assessment of products.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has been debated for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When exposed to diverse perspectives and disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify patterns, and draw connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. This holistic approach allows for more creative solutions and a deeper understanding of complex issues. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better analyze the impact of trade routes on societal development, while a scientist with a background in philosophy might be more equipped to grapple with ethical dilemmas in research. 

Secondly, a broad education cultivates adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's interconnected and dynamic society, individuals must be able to navigate diverse fields and adapt to new challenges. A broad knowledge base provides the foundation for lifelong learning and the ability to seamlessly transition between different career paths or fields of study. For example, a student with a broad understanding of literature, history, and technology might be better prepared to adapt to the evolving landscape of the digital age, compared to someone solely focused on a single, specialized field. 

In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base is essential for fostering critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, individuals become more well-rounded, adaptable, and equipped to navigate the complexities of the 21st century.",
"I strongly agree to this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are two reasons why i believe that the statement is correct. Young people nowadays do not have much free time and do not have time to think about their surroundings, and they also tend to be extremely lazy and are not willing to help for their communities.
These days it seems to be that young people have a very tight schedule. Most teenagers have school till the evening, and some may even have extra curricular activities or part time jobs to earn some pocket money. Unlike before, young people are very independent and uses time wisely which would benefit them in any possible ways. Since they have a tight schedule and do not have other spare times other than thinking about themselves, they do not give enough time to helping their communities.
In addition to their tight schedules, young people nowadays are extremely lazy. This may be because of the fast developing techonologies, such as use of computers, and easy access of transportations to places. Teenagers are especially lazy when it comes to solving problems. They believe that they have better things to do than helping their communities, and avoid volunteer works. However, problems may change once money comes into an issue. Young people nowadays love money, and they would most likely do anything which involves earning money. If the government makes this community help as some sort of a part time job, young people may find some interests in helping.
Today, young people are much more independent than they were before, and are extremely self centered. I believe that this problem should deffinately change as soon as possible. In this way, young people would learn that helping others is an important aspect in their lives.",
"yes I am agree that young people enjoy life more than other people . I am agree with that statement beacuse when people is young they have more enthusiasm to live and enjoy life .

first reason  why I am agree young people enjoy life more beacuse student life is also part of the young life during this period student have to go study for different places . So student can enjoy of travel ,can enjoy food of different variety . some student can also prefer to go abrode for their study .so these student can take fun from that country culture .

second reason why I am agree young people enjoy life moreBecause young people is very curios about  every thing , so they are taking   steps to acheive and discover new thing . after discover these thing they become happy . young people enjoy in this way.in the old age these are the events not happens so they are lving silent life .

third reason why I am agree young people enjoy life more beacuse
for taking enjoy physical fitness and good helth plays a verry importent role for taking enjoy because if your fitness and your helthis not good  then your mind will not able to enjoy properly .because during youg age generely  we are fit and have a good helth but duiring old age, people start problem with helth .Because a good helth  have a good mind ,in old erage we can",
"Many companies spend a lot of money in advertisment. Also, they have special section and skilled people for advertisments. All these to market them products to customers. In my opinion, I totally agree with statment that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are for three reason.
     First of all, any products in the world have advantages and disadvantages. The best product is that has many advantages and few disadvantages. In all advertisments, only the advantage of products is seen but the disadvantages is not. if person see advertisement, the product will seem much better than it really is.
      Second, Most companies use multimedi -Text, sound, picture, vedio - in products advertisments. These combination of technology will put the product in the suitable environment that will effect on the custome. For example, if you would like to buy a television and you see advertiment about two kind of television. First one using multimedi that shows the television with high resolution and you best program and best actor on it. Second advertisment without using any technology. I think you will select the first one because you think is better even though if the first television an dsecond television are same in features.
         Finally, Many companies contract with beautiful men and women or with famous player or actors to present in advertisments and use products. If you see product with your favorite player or actor, you will buy the product even though it is not good product.
          Inconclusion, I totally think that products have less quality than they are appear in advertisments for three reasos. only advantages are presented on advertisments, companies use mutimedi in products advertisments, and companies contract with famous people to present in products advertisments. I think , we have to be accurate before buy any product especially if we see it in advertisment.",
"I believe all people may enjoy their lives independent from their age because all of the life stages has their own advantages and disadvantages. Thus, I don't agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Assume that you're 70 and you don't have grandchildren. If having children of your children is important to you, then you won't be happy and won't be enjoying your life. Furthermore, assume that you are in your twenties and you cannot go to dance with your friends. Again if it is relevant to you, you won't be enjoying your life and age. On the other hand if you have all your expectations from your age, then you'll be the best person in the world and enjoy your life more than anyone in the world. 

First of all, it's true that being young brings some advantages about enjoying life. Like you're energetic, healthy and careless than old people do. Traveling, making sports and dating are easy for you. However, it has disadvantages. You may travel more than an old person but in case if you have enough money and permission. You cannot shut the door and say to your parents that you're going to a spiritual trip to India. They will ask you why and most probably they won't let you. 

Being older has also its disadvantages and advantages. When you are old, this means you are full of knowledge at least in one specific topic. Moreover you have one-life long experiences. Therefore, people like and want to talk to you due to getting benefit from your knowledge and experiences. You have lots of things to tell such as your memories of childhood, experiences in your work and all these funny and bad luck events. You have faced more years of the world's history that youngsters cannot have a chance to see. Of course, as a direct disadvantage of this view, you will not be able to see the next generation. 

To conclude, elder people may also enjoy life as much as young people for me. It's solely about what you expect from life and what the life gives to you. If they fit to one another, you will be enyojing your life at a maximum level whatever your age is.",
"Community service is one of the  important aspects in which young people have to take part.I believe that young people nowadays have the intension to help their community but they do not give enough time to do that.There might be many factors impeding their involvement in helping the community.Young people are known to be the enthusiastic and creative of all ages.This enthusiasm,creativity,energy can in fact be used to help their community.
                     Firstly, the  younger generations are mostly students.They are busy most of the time with their academic stuff like college,school,friends.They hardly get time to think of helping their community.In case if they are having any thought of helping the community, that thought is being masked by the others which he would love or prefer to do.For example, a young boy might be willing to help uneducated children by spending his weekend teaching them the basic concepts.But his friends may bring a proposal of going to a picnic the same time.It is the general tendency of young people to prefer the latter to the former.
                      There are many ways in which young people can be involved in helping the community.For example, students of medicinal back groung can help create general awareness among their community regarding the diseases and the preventive measures that can be taken to avoid the same.This will be an immense help.They might face problems in getting the time for such things but they can somehow manage things to do the same like forming a group and taking turns in doing the same.
                       Younger people who are students or usually freshers who have started their job career generally try to concentrate on career aspects which demand more time like studying or working hard for their job.This eventually leaves them very less time to help a community.They prefer to relax in the available time rather than helping their community.Motivation of younger people to involve in suck service is lacking these days.So,the young people's involvement  to help their community is highly dependent on the time which they can take aside for such service excluding their essential activities.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When exposed to diverse subjects, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple perspectives, identify patterns, and draw connections between seemingly disparate fields. This holistic understanding allows them to approach challenges with a more comprehensive and innovative mindset. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the social and economic factors that led to historical events. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base enhances communication and collaboration. In today's interconnected world, individuals are increasingly required to work across disciplines and cultures. A broad understanding of different subjects allows individuals to communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds, fostering empathy and understanding. This is particularly crucial in fields like research, where collaboration between specialists is essential for groundbreaking discoveries. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base promotes intellectual curiosity and lifelong learning. When individuals are exposed to a wide range of subjects, they are more likely to develop a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore new ideas. This lifelong learning attitude is essential for personal growth and adaptability in a rapidly changing world. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers a more holistic and enriching approach to learning. It fosters critical thinking, enhances communication, and promotes intellectual curiosity, ultimately contributing to a more informed and adaptable society.",
"With reference to these different solution, I think that both the possibilities have got advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specific subject depends on several factors such as the country where do you have to work and which kind of job you are interested to.
Indeed each country has got its own traditions and political system that surely influence the academic choice of a person.
In my country, it is more common to have a broad knowledge of many subjects so people could have a wider choice between many jobs.
It is also very important which job you would like to do in the future.
Indeed scientifical jobs need  specialized knowledge of a subject such as chemistry or math. On the other hand there are several jobs which need a broad knowledge of many subjects. For example a person who wants to teach licterature have to study grammar, poetry, history, and so on.

Although specialize in one specific subject has got its positive factors, such as the possibility to find early a good job, I surely prefer to have a broad knowledge for several reasons.
First of all, I would like to know a lot about our world, and if I studied a specific subject I would know only a topic.
Secondly by having broad knowledge you will be able to choose between different jobs. After all you can specialize yourself after that you have found a good job.
So I generally do  agree with the statement",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a complex one. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.


Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By understanding concepts from various disciplines, individuals can approach challenges from multiple perspectives. For example, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the causes of historical events, while a scientist with a background in literature might be more adept at communicating complex scientific findings. This interdisciplinary approach allows for more comprehensive and innovative solutions. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base promotes adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world.

Those with a diverse range of knowledge are better equipped to navigate these changes and seize emerging opportunities. For instance, a person with a strong foundation in both technology and humanities might be more successful in adapting to the evolving job market. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches our understanding of the world and our place in it. By exploring different fields of study, we gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things. This appreciation fosters empathy, tolerance, and a sense of global citizenship. For example, studying art history can provide insights into different cultures and perspectives, while learning about environmental science can raise awareness about the importance of sustainability. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base is essential for navigating the complexities of the modern world. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of our interconnected world. By embracing a diverse range of knowledge, we can become more well-rounded individuals and contribute to a more informed and compassionate society.",
"Nowadays, in Korea, I think many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Instead, they spend their time on their own tasks. I'd like to give you some of examples of young people in Korea.

The first example is that many young people say that they are helping their communities. They claim that they go to orphange or public places such as post office or police station in order to help their communities. Actually, they are not  going to the places in order to contribute to society. They volunteer in fake in order to get scores or fulfill the time required  to go to high school or colleges. If the required time of volunteering is fulfilled, they do not volunteer any more. 

The second example is that, in Korea, when a social matter occured, many young people protested against it and they continually protested until it was improved.  However, nowadays, most young people are ignorant of the social matters. They only pay attention to their own. Because of that, there are many social problems unsolved throughout the country. 

 Though the some young people are really spending time on helping communities, most of the young people do not help their communities. They only do their tasks. They do not give much attention to their societies. I think the main reason for this is that the 'Individualism' which was spread to young people from European countries or America.

 We, Koreans, should follow our tradition, which put a lot of emphasis on helping communities. If we behave like this, our country cannot develp well. If we want to make a better country, we, young people should spend some time helping to the communites. These kinds of activities may not be hard. 

 We can pick some trashes scattered in the streets or we can help disabled people in the road. We can give some of our money to poor people or we can visit hospitals or people in need once in a week. These might be not tough. Instead of spending time on ourselves, we can help communities with those kinds of acitivities. Through our efforts, we can make a better world. Help communities!",
"communites reffer to our friends,relatives,colliges nowadays every body are concerned about there own but not about communites every body are thinking about their own and their family only they are not intrested about any body they are not in a possition to care to some neddy people 

                   Yes i agree that young people now a days are not giving enough time for helping their communites because most of them think that this is not their work they are always thinking about their own family and themselvs some of them think that it is waste of time and money they also think that it is foolish to help others we can see such a type of people in our dialy life also for example if any. accidient occurs on a bussy road no body care about the feldown one no body will stop their vechiles and help hte accidient ones most them will be scolding them moving forward but they wont help them
              Like this we can take many examples in our dialy life only
most of the youngesters are thinking that helping other communities wont help them they are thinking that many are there for helping them they will understand this when they are in needy .
                     when we help others in any probelem they will help us when we are in problem no body are understanging this every body are thinking about their own they are in a mood that they wont gain anything by doing such a type of social work helping others in needy is a social work of every common man we should develop ourselves
that by helping others  we are removing others pain through our hands we can prove ourselves as humanbeings by giving our hands for help of others .",
"In my opinion , young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities. There are a few reasons for this, which have come about as a result of the changes in society and the outlooks that these young people have! Most reasons centre around the issue of time that is available to perform such activities, while there are some that pertain to the psychological outlook of the person.

           Today's youth are too caught up in simply achieving things for their selfish needs. A strong assertion, no doubt, but parental pressure, peer pressure and hence the need to deliver results in an ever-so widenening world with large numbers of competitors puts a strain on the individual. He/she is simply left with no time to cope with mundane things, leave alone the community he/she lives in! Additionally, lives lead by some of the youth today are too fast paced for them to be worried about the community they reside in. Any free time available at their disposal will go to satisfying their personal needs. The community, unfortunately, thus ranks very low in terms of priority! A personal example can help throw some light in this matter;
Being a full time student leaves me very little time to allow myself to indulge in my music, which is a favourite hobby. Why would I spend it unselfishly on  the community?

              This leaves us with the system of education in the scheme of public service. A good, if not decent, education would inculcate certain values that would result in the develpoment of a complete individual, who is part of, and thus sees himself/herself to be responsible for the community they live in. This does not seem to happen as effectively as it is expected to be. Many students go through their school and ultimately entire lives blind to the help that their communities are crying out for! Is it not the fundamental responsibilty of these schools to ensure that the youth be made aware and proactive in this regard?! 

                To conclude, I would like to say that an awareness of the advantages a person who helps his community has over a person who doesn't engage in such activities, needs to be brought, not mention certain changes in their hectic work schedules as well!!",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, the social pressures of fitting in and navigating complex relationships can contribute to stress and uncertainty. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find excitement in new experiences and adventures, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from the comfort of routine and the wisdom gained through years of experience. For example, a young person might find joy in traveling to a new country, while an older person might find contentment in spending time with their grandchildren. 

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that happiness is not a constant state. Both young and old individuals experience periods of joy and sorrow, and their ability to enjoy life is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond age. Ultimately, the key to finding happiness lies in embracing the present moment, appreciating the good things in life, and cultivating a positive outlook, regardless of one's age.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong endeavor, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's academic horizons is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual flexibility, enhances critical thinking skills, and provides a more holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas across disciplines, fostering creativity and innovation. For instance, a historian with a grasp of economics might analyze historical events with a deeper understanding of their underlying economic forces. Similarly, a scientist with knowledge of literature can better communicate their findings to a wider audience. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of complex issues.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. By encountering diverse perspectives and methodologies, individuals develop the ability to analyze information objectively, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This ability is crucial in today's information-saturated world, where critical evaluation is essential to navigate complex issues and make informed decisions.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters intellectual flexibility, enhances critical thinking skills, and provides a more holistic understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, individuals equip themselves with the tools necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing and interconnected world.",
"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements are to help the company to commercial their own products to people, to make better profits out of it for themselves. Then with that fact, it is obvious that they should make the products seem much better so that people would buy it more. 
I myself, and everyone might have experienced it at least once in their life, that whenever you go to resturant  or stop at the food place, you will see all these pictures of the food in the menu. They all seem very delicious and look nice, but sometimes it does not taste or look as what you expected it to be. Advertisements does this to make you eat their food, which will help them to make money for themselves.
No one will want to waste their money by purchasing anything wrong or bad. People look for better and good one's for themselves, therefore, advertisements try to show best abilities out of the products as much as they can. Sometimes even by making up the fact that really doesn't refer to the actual product, they compeat with other companies to sell more of their products than other's.
In my opinion, it is understandable that they do this. Since we already know that most of products are commercialized and exaggurated in a better and good way by the advertisement, we could avoid buying any fake or bad products. Plus, it actually feels better for us to buy something that has more fancy and nicer advertisement than the ones that are not very commercialized. Becuase by that we could know if the company is well and rich enough to support the product, which again will tell us that company has been making good profits for themselves by a lot of people who has been buying their products. Therefore, I agree the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are which is true and understandable in many way.",
"Everybody has different opinions and thoughts about the upcoming generation. Some people doesn`t think that young people  give enough time to helping their communities. As a young person I agree with this statement and i think that young people can do more to help their communities.
	Every country is raising the childrens with different cultures, thats why I just can give opinions about my country. Nowadays, we see that most of the criminals are young people. I can`t really say that it is all the young peoples fault. I don`t think the community is helping young people with their problems also, which makes us come to this point. If the community is not giving enough attention to the young people, they can`t expect young people to help their community also.
	I know that young people are the survivors of their country. They have alot of responsibilties for the community. Most people expect them to do better stuff than they are doing now.  There is a big generation gap between our parents and us. They do everything to help their community and we have to take them as a role model for us, but because of this generation gap young people just don`t think it is very interesting. I know that young people doesn`t help the community but we have to think this statement from a different point of view also. They are young people and they have their own problems which makes them think that it is more important then the world. I am sure that no matter which country they are from it is all same with young people. That is not fair to put the responsibilty of the community to their shoulders. I am sure that nowadays young people are going to be good adults which help their community and going to have alot of responsibilty.",
"A question has been raised about whether or not the young people  nowadays devote their time to helping their communities. 
In respons to this question, I think that there are two kind of young people nowadays: one kind is more polite, other kind is less polite.

Usually, the young peole are more polite because they have their parents more quite and more lovely. Maybe when this young people  have a problem they can ask a help from your parents without having fear to them. So, for this kind of young people is normal to be helped and when they see other person that suffering they would help him or her.

Instead, the young people are less polite because their parents are more angry or maybe their parents  pass few time with them.
So, usually when they have some problems they resolve it alone without asking a help and if they see a man who have a problem they think that he or she can resolve alone.

So, I think that it's important that the parents pass the most of their time with their children. My parents work every day, and they come back in my home very later.  I never asked them to help me because they aren't. So I have difficult to ask or to give a help and I prefer stay alone rather than stay with my community.",
"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. because young people are very energish. They want to do sports, play game, like the other, get marry with the other, study about unknown things and so on. Many kinds of thing wait for them. By contrast, old people have already done many kinds of things for they were young and energish and already enjoyed. This time, they shoud support young people like they let old people support who support them before. 

But I dont mean that old people mast not enjoy. They also shoud enjoy very much. what I want to say is that yong people are star and old people are thier manager.everyone shoud enjoy but also old people shoud support them.",
"The statements touches upon a very contraversial topic. It is true that young people spend more time on parties and traveling than the old people. However, I completely disagrees with the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do. I have many reasons for my belief.

It is true that because of age a older person would not be able to enjoy the party life and traveling around the world. But it is equally true that not only physical activities, but also other activities contribute to the definition of ""enjoying life to its fullest"". To give an example, I had a mathematics professor who helped me prepared for compitive exams and standadised tests out side the syllabus. Although he was retiered, he had a true passion for maths and even at age of eighty he used to solve many challenging puzzles and do recreational mathematical work. Apart from mathematics, he also had a group of friends, with whom he used to play cards and always participate in various district and national level compititions in chess. He also kept visiting his two sons once every year and taught his grandsons the secretsof leading a successful life. From all these and many more activities, he derived the immense pleasure of leading a healthy life.

On the otherhand, consider the yonger generation, where many people commit numerous crimes in the name of having fun in life. These people suffer severely, when they have to face the punishments offered by the law for their arrogant attitude. We can find numerous examples of young people commiting inexcusable crimes and facing the punishment for life. On the contrary, in such cases the young people have to face more sorrows in life than the old people do.

I strongly believe, that to enjoy life, one must have the ability to give joy to other people and share thier sworrows, in whatever small ways possible. On can achive the ultimate joy of life only if he is successful in creating a harmony in the community around himself. And I strongly believe there is no age limit to do this, and hence there is no age limit to be happy in life.",
"By discussing the statement, we first have to define what >>helping their communities<< means. What are the communities? The communities may be some of sport, music or religious. And what is helping? Helping may mean helping in the familiy (which is part of the community) or by helping direct the community. 

There are several methods of helping in communities. These methods changed along the years:

In former days people were perhaps more friedly and more helpful to each other. They were another generation and had other living conditions. I also think that the people have had another familiar surrounding in which they lived and worked. As young people they had to help the family e.g by going in the fields and doing farming. They also used to help other families, because they benefits from each other. The families had not so much money and so much things like we have today. So helping was very important. This were a community in these days.

Nowadays the familiar surrounding is not so close as it was a hundret years ago. There are more singles or more families with divorced parents. So the surrounding in which the young people live nowadays is completely different to thos who lived a hundret years ago. But this fact I think is the critical point: The young people nowadays want to have a bigger or a more family like family. Because of this fact I think, nowadays young people are also engaged in their communities by searching a more completely familiy.

So I disagree with the statement. My own experience confirms this. A lot of my friends are in several sport or music communities. And they help there for non profit. I am in our religous community in my town and I am helping the pastor for non profit.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This exaggeration is achieved through a variety of techniques, including selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals.
Firstly, advertisements often present only the most positive aspects of a product, carefully omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might highlight its sleek design and advanced camera features, but fail to mention its short battery life or limited storage capacity. This selective information creates an idealized image of the product, leading consumers to believe it is superior to its competitors.
Secondly, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, they create a positive association with the product, even if it is not inherently desirable. For example, a car commercial might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, suggesting that purchasing the car will bring similar joy and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the product's actual functionality and value.
Finally, advertisements often present unrealistic portrayals of products and their benefits. This is particularly evident in beauty and fashion advertisements, where models with flawless skin and perfect bodies are used to promote products that promise miraculous results. Such unrealistic expectations can lead consumers to feel disappointed and dissatisfied with the actual product, as it fails to live up to the exaggerated claims.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority employ deceptive tactics to make products seem more appealing than they truly are. By selectively presenting information, appealing to emotions, and creating unrealistic portrayals, advertisements distort consumer perceptions and influence purchasing decisions. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these techniques and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This selling techinque is used to attract customers. The advertisements mostly over-emphasis the multi-functions, the graurantee refund policy, and the prices of the products.
	Most of the products are stated that they have more than one funtion. For example, there are multi-functions of the most Chinese herbal tea. If you drink such kind of tea, more than one type of diseases, such as headaches, stomach hurt, heart burn, and even fat burning, you can be healed.  However, most of the products from the advertisements do not state clearly how long the proclaimed effects will be work ed out when you buy the product.
	Besides, most advertisemets emphasize that there is a hundred percentage of confidence for the refund policy. If you are not satisfied with the product after you purchase it, you will get back all your money when you send back the product to the company. However, such kind of policy has limited return time an specific condition.  For example, if you want to return a bottle of moisturising cream, you will have hundred percentage refunds only within a week of purchasing, and not more than one-third of the cream is used; otherwise, you are not eligibled to make such kind of claim.
	Moreover, the price of the product you seem in the advertisements is much cheaper than what you want to buy. For example, the price of a dress in the advertisement is about 9.99 dollar per item. However, this price is only for limited items or limited to specific stores, color or size. As a result, you will pay more than what you espected. In addition, most of the price listed in the advertisement is not inculded the tax or the shipping fees. So you will paid higher prize for the product, rather than it is listed in the advertisements.
	So we have to check all the details about the products we want to buy. Do not believe what you see from the advertisements totally. We have to become a smart customer.",
"Although people specialized in one specific subject have often a better knowledge of it as I do, I prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic sujects for two main reasons.

Firstly, I believe that a good knowledge on several topics will help me to find more jobs in very different areas. Indeed, I am doing engineering studies and I like both the automotive and the aeronautic industries.  In order to start my first job in one of these industries and to have the possibility to switch to the other one after a few years, it is crucial for me to keep a broad knowledge in both two fields.

Secondly, a broad academic knowledge will help me to better understand the world around me. Indeed, even if a strong knowledge would allow me to understand a specific subject more in details, I think that a broad knowledge will allow me to understand many more subjects with a sufficient comprehension of them. A good example can also be taken from my studies. I learned fluid mechanics in details and I only had a short introduction to other subjects such as turbomachinery or acousitc. Nevertheless, my basics in acoustics were more than sufficient to understand the most common acoustic phenomenon that surronds me in my day-to-day life. I can now easily understand how a speaker or a microphone is working and explain the basic principles to my friends, even if I do not know all the theory in details.

In conclusion, although some students prefer to specialize in one specific subject, I definitely prefer to acquire a broad knowledge on many academic subjects. It will help both in my professional life as well as in my life out of the office.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in community service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives addressing social issues. From organizing environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice, young people are using their energy and creativity to make a positive impact. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their commitment to creating a better future for their communities.

Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time at local organizations, contributing to the well-being of their communities. From assisting at soup kitchens to mentoring underprivileged children, they dedicate countless hours to improving the lives of others. These acts of service not only benefit the community but also foster personal growth and a sense of belonging.
While it's easy to focus on the perceived apathy of some young people, it's crucial to recognize the vast number who are actively engaged in making a difference. Their dedication and commitment to their communities are a testament to their generation's potential for positive change. Therefore, it's unfair and inaccurate to claim that young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a mistake to assume that happiness is solely a product of age. Both young and old individuals can experience profound joy and fulfillment, albeit in different ways. 

Firstly, young people often face a unique set of pressures that can hinder their enjoyment of life. The constant pursuit of education, career goals, and social acceptance can create a sense of overwhelming responsibility and anxiety. This pressure can overshadow the simple pleasures that older individuals may take for granted, such as spending time with loved ones or pursuing hobbies. For example, a young professional may feel immense stress juggling work deadlines and personal commitments, while a retired individual may find immense satisfaction in tending to their garden or volunteering in their community. 

Secondly, older individuals have the benefit of accumulated life experience, which can enhance their appreciation for the present moment. They have witnessed both the highs and lows of life, and this perspective allows them to savor the simple joys that may have been overlooked in their youth. For instance, an elderly couple may find immense happiness in a quiet evening together, reminiscing about their shared history, while a young couple may be consumed by the anxieties of building a future. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with a certain carefree spirit, it is not a guarantee of happiness. Both young and old individuals can experience profound joy and fulfillment, depending on their individual circumstances and perspectives. It is important to recognize that happiness is not solely a product of age, but rather a result of finding meaning and purpose in life, regardless of one's stage of life.",
"Marketing is an activity that has grown fast and steady for the last few decades. Some argue that it is exclusively a lucrative, almost an inmoral activity. Others regard it as creative and valuable as art. 
Probably the fact that has been critisized more convincingly is the fact that advertisers tend to overstate the qualities of a product in order to sell it. People who make such kind of statements, as the one presented above, are convinced that marketing is the exclusive art of embellishing reality and lying about it, since it presents a product that is not quite what is promised to the consumer. And of course almost everyone has suffered a huge dissappointment when buying for example a tooth paste that does NOT whiten the teeth in five seconds, as it was stated in the package, or when noticing that a package of regular batteries last the same or more than the ones the bunny said would last forever.                                  
I believe, every proffesion is susceptible to human vices. Lying is therefore  not exclusive of advertrisers, nor is it characteristic of them. I think there are, of course, advertisers who will be willing to sell any product regardless of it is something benign for society or not, or if it is actually the product they are promising to consumers. Nonetheless, these events occur in almost every proffession, accountants that do not pay their costumers taxes, drivers that drive unsafely, real estators who sell damaged or overprized properties. So, the fact that some people will want to take advantage of other people is present wherever thers is interaction between human beings. The only thing we can do about it, is to rely on ethical grounds and hope that eveveryone will perform the job they  are expected to in the most honest manner.",
"We live in a world which is very interesting and contains plenty of Knowledge. Isn't fair to say which one is better for us, either in having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or be a specialized in one specific subject. I beleive we should have knowledge of many subjects and be a specialized in any one subject to which we feel that suits us. 

            Let us have examples, As we are in our school we are taught to different subjects like Mathematics, Life Sciences, Social Studies. As we grow up to University Level, we are given a chance to choose what we are interested in like  Medicine, Engineering, Business Administration, Music, Law etc. So i beleive we should have enough knowledge in all aspects of life. 

             If i beleive in having broad knowledge of many subjects rather than be a specialized, then it is highly impossible for me to remember the things. For example a Doctor can't be a lawyer because the medicine knowledge is endless where as the lawyer has to remember all the laws and he has to upgrade himself with change in Government and in ""law and order"". So a person cant be specialized in many subjects.

	Let us say i beleive in second point of being a specialized in one subject rather than have enough knowledge in various subjects. . Suppose I am secialized in Business Administration and if someone asks me about the Business I am able to answer to all of their questions and if one day someone asks me anything irrelevent to my subject of Business I may not be able to answer the question.
	
  	If we take an example of sports, we often have interest in many sports but we love only one sport. Thats why an football commentator cannot do commentary in Badminton because he may not be knowing of the rules correctly.

	Learn the good things as much as we can whether it may be from a scholar or from a small kid because learning never ends.",
"The given statement is a cynical and skeptic comment which is thrown at every generation. I can say with great pride that my generation can annul this cynicism in a number of different ways.
In my own university we have a number of different activities through which we can contribute to our communitity. All these activities come under the banner of what is called the National Service Scheme or NSS for short. I myself am a volunteer of this organisation and thus vehemently oppose the given statement.
There is a wide range of ways in which we volunteers contribute to our community. Every six months we organize a blood donation camp in our university in which students, faculty as well as people living close to the university come in great numbers to donate their blood. Recently, I was also part of a successful project to assist the gardeners in improving the condition of trees in our campus. Every alternate day around thirty students would spend the evenings watering the existing trees, pruning them, removing weeds and also planting new trees. We even managed to arrange for a water tanker to accompany us, thus saving the burden of carrying buckets all over the campus. Our efforts over the past semester have paid off and the gardeners have now indicated that extra help is not required as the overall condition of trees has improved.
Other students who enjoy teaching have taken up a project in which they devote part of their time to interact with and teach blind children in a blind school in our city.
The people who lament the decrease in such social activities among the youth should make a closer examination which will reveal that the youth social organisations are alive and flourishing. Some of the graduates from my university have taken this community service to the next level by adopting it as their profession. This has manifested itself in the form of Non Governmental Organisations which are non-profit organisations whose aim is improving some aspect of society. NGOs can work towards providing safe drinking water to villages to working for the betterment of the lives of the elderly. Young people with a passion for changing their societies are forming such organisations and are doing great wonders for their communities.",
"In my opinion, is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of a specialization in one of them. I say this because I think that is the best solution in order to find a work in today's society, where companies are continously on change and require a huge flexibility and adaptability for the new works. 
According to this, school must provide to give a basical instruction, teaching many different subjects. In this way, each student will have a quite complete background  in the fileld he choose. 
I think that also specialization is important for work, of course, because it implies that a person is really good on doing something specific. But I also think that an high level of specialization could be reached only with years and years of study and work, and school can't give this opportunity to everybody.
An example: I study design, but lots of kind of designs. Interior design, virtual design, graphic design and much more. But what I really like to do is Web design. So, school gives me first the opportunity to learn about different tipes of design and, second, to understand which is the best for me. After the school I can specialize myself in Web design by work, because I have a basical preparation that school gave me, and, in the same time, the other students in my class could choose another specialization, according to their preferences. 
This model of teaching subjects gives lots of advantages, because it isn't neither rigid nor boring. It gives anyone the possibility to choose, without create limits. 
Academic subjects are only the start up of the student's working life, that he can and must develope in his career. But at the same time they are very important, because allow the student the opportunity to understand what he really like to do in his future.",
"Of course i completely suuport the idea  that most advertisements make products seem much much better than they really are.
Let me talk about an experience of myself,i have followed the adeverements many time in making decisions and after that i found that i was mistaking.

For examples, i watched on the television about a  new kitchen tools which was very nice and very cheap.In that time particulary i was preparing my apartement and i was looking for such things.
In the first i thought it was very nice but after buying it i found it was a big mistake to buy it because it spent onle one week and after that it completely destructed.

Another thing which happen to me while i was looking for a insurance company  for my new car, i red an announcement about a new insurance company,that advertisment was like a dream,it said that if any small thing happened to your car it will be fixed totally free,and if the car is completely destructed,you will have a new car,when  i red it i decided that i will join this company to insure on my car,after one year of joining that company and paying all my money,i made an acciedent with my car,and when i went to the insurance company,i was astonished to hear that i would not get any money because i was mistaken.

 Another one more thing,when i was look for a nice place to spend my honey mool there with my new wife i heared about a new tourism company.I went to it and i asked them for a nice place to go and they advised me to go for a certain place.But when i went there i found that every thing is very bad.

So that i think that one should not follow the advertisements when shearching for any thing because many companies try to sell its bad products by making a very incorret advertisements and they pay atremendous amount of money in it and spend alot of money to make it looks like what we see.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have a broad understanding of many subjects or specialize in one has been debated for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial, fostering adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's rapidly evolving world, careers and industries are constantly shifting. Having a diverse range of knowledge allows individuals to readily transition between fields, explore new opportunities, and remain competitive in the job market. For example, a historian with a strong understanding of economics might be able to seamlessly transition into a career in policy analysis, drawing upon their knowledge of both historical trends and economic principles. 

Furthermore, a broad education fosters critical thinking skills. By exposing individuals to different perspectives and disciplines, it encourages them to analyze information from multiple angles, challenge assumptions, and form well-rounded opinions. This ability to think critically is essential in navigating a complex world filled with diverse viewpoints and conflicting information. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base promotes a more holistic understanding of the world. By connecting different disciplines, individuals gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge and the complexities of human society. For instance, understanding the historical context of scientific discoveries can provide a richer understanding of their impact on society, while exploring the ethical implications of technological advancements can shed light on the social and cultural consequences of innovation. 

In conclusion, while specialization can lead to deep expertise, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world, equipping individuals with the skills and perspectives necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing and interconnected society.",
"In this years, the young people don't give enought importance to helping their communities. i think that it is true but tthe young are not guilty of this choose because the society don't bring them to choose to help the other. One of the reasons that bring to this situation is that there is bad informations or there isn't, about this statement.
Another reason that doesn't permitted to helping the communities is the time: the modern society doesn't give free time to the people.
In this way, the people used their few time for themself and they don't think to helping other people.
I am a Boy Scout in Italy and I had the opportunity to help the other people. I like helping my community because to give a little smile to someone is free, and when you can receved a smile to return, you will be the happiest person.
I know some youngs that liked to give some of them to another one, but they are a few group, but they are!
I think that the associations that work in communities can be sensibilize the young in this direction, but the ability to helping the other, without a payment with money, is not in anyone.
In my country there are a project about the sensibilization of the young for helping their community: that is presented as a work and who want work in can bring to home some money.
That is the only way to bring the young people to helping their communities: give them money to give to other a smile!

"I dont agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people. The given statement can be accepted only to the extent of  physical strength.The older people can not do all aspects of work physicaly as actively as young people can do.But in 
 other aspects they can be on par with people.Before saying how let me  categorise different types of enjoying life.It could be in terms of 
spirituality,philanthropy,through experience  which comes along with age,perception of life etc.
     An older person can how to relieve from stress compare to an younger person  which leads to hapiness or unhapiness in life.Well i believe that an individual can enjoy his life  only when he has peace. An older person can better deal the traumatic stiuations that every one faces in life than  a younger person.The younger person enjoys his life mostly  through matrliastic pursuit which is only temporary and not the real joy.But at the most an  older person who swam accross the age of youth is more inclined towards spiritual bliss.
He is more religious and he can see the path between him and the god and that is the real and true joy.
What is so sick about among people  is that  they dont have time to enjoy different aspects of life like nature,literature and arts in their busy schedule of life of accademics and carrier.An yong person may
not experience the same quality of joy as an older person can while 
jogging or listening to music or showing concern and understanding 
people come to them .What iIwant to conclude is that the definitio for enjoyment may not be same for all. each individual can enjoy life according to the way he perceive it.So i dont agree that young people enjoy life more than older people.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is an oversimplification. Both age groups face unique challenges and opportunities that shape their perspectives on life, making a definitive comparison impossible. 

Young people often experience a sense of freedom and possibility that comes with fewer responsibilities. They are less burdened by financial worries, career pressures, or family obligations. This allows them to pursue their passions, explore new experiences, and embrace spontaneity. For example, a young person might travel the world, pursue a creative hobby, or engage in adventurous activities without the constraints of a demanding job or family commitments. 

However, older people often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and a greater appreciation for the simple things. They have experienced both joy and sorrow, success and failure, and have learned valuable lessons along the way. This wisdom allows them to find contentment in the present moment and appreciate the beauty in everyday life. For instance, an older person might find immense satisfaction in spending time with loved ones, nurturing their garden, or simply enjoying a quiet evening at home. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that varies greatly from person to person, regardless of age. While youth may have a certain advantage in terms of freedom and energy, older people possess a wealth of experience and wisdom that can contribute to a fulfilling life. To claim that one age group enjoys life more than the other is a reductionist view that ignores the nuances of human experience.",
"I completley disagree with the statment presented in this section. To posses any form of knowlege is an advantage for any individual. However, stating that it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects as opposed to specializing in one subject is a complete error. There are many reasons which serve to justify this claim. One, reason which serves as a contradiction to the claim presented in this writing section is if everyone had a ""broad knowledge in many subjects"" there would be no one to specialize in specific subjects and this would hinder any advancments in subjects that are not studied specifically. 
	The statement that having knowledge in one specific subject as being less beneficial then having knowledge in many subjects greatly contradicts the way our world operates today. If in today's world we didn't have people who mastered and speciffically looked into subjects where would we be in terms of advancment. For example, when looking at an individual who specialilzes in computers, if they had just had knowledge in many academic subjects then how can we see any potential for improvments. When an individual specializes in a field or subject they contribute to the advancments and discoveries, which in the long-run will benifet our society as a whole. Another example which may be included to illustrate the contradiction of the statement presented in this section is if everyone ""only had a broad knowledge of many subjects"" then where would we be in the medecine field. With an increase in diseases and viruses in today's world it is necessary to specialize in specific subjects, that way we can improve the society we live in.
	To have a broad knowledge in many subjects, and no specific knowledge in some subjects would be a disaster to mankind. This is because you would have to picture a world with no technological, no medicene advancment and a world void of what our society needs to prosper and become a better place.",
"We live in a community that needs some help from all the its individuals, espacielly from the young people, were they give most of their time for playing games, going out and having fun. By that they totaly forget about their community and the duties that have to do for it.
                 In our days today we have to give young people the maximume attention that we can offer them, because we live in a society that has many tools to blind them and make them lose the right track. For example if we ask a young boy weather he likes to go fishing or go clean the beach from wastes, his answer is going to be ""lets go fishing"", he might not even know that there are some people whom actually clean the beach. This happens from the lack of attention that we should have given  for them to know more about their community and the problems that their community faces.
                 Another factor which makes a young boy go fishing, is the number of places that we have for children to have fun and play and at the same time the absence of places that tell our children about out community and that we actually have duties towards our community. 
               I strongly agree with the statment",
"In my opinion the best option is to have knowledge of many academic subjects.  It means to belong general culture that could be used in a day-life time. It means you can speak and keep a conversation on differrent variety of topics with a lot of people, even if some of them are not belonging to your class or to your culture or religion. Even to find a position on the job market is easier because you are not connected to specific competence areas. In example I can mention the profession of the doctor and the dentist's one. Both have kind of preparation about medical notions and acknowledge of the human anatomy, but the doctor can choose his specialization after the study. Before, he gathered many information about all the subjects of linked to the human body and then he will focus his choice to work in  surgery , radiology, gynecology or any other department.
Dentist knows from the very beginning what will be work on and their studies are focused on specific subjects regarding the mouth. And they will work as dentist, no other choice. You are tied up to the formation you have received.
 
On other hand, having a specialized knowledge of one subject  allows  them to be much more professional in shorter time. And probably to reach the goal before the others.

But in a world where every company has the need to get different his production, probably they will require a feature of suitability in the 
mind of their employee. Passing through a department to another one with different tasks requires an elastic mind and could help you to better understand the interconnected problems between the production areas.

To conclude I would like to support my opinion with a strange personal example. I am a n average player of many sports: tennis, volleyball, football, swimming and many oter else. I am not a pro in anyone of them but I can continuously choose friends to play with.
Never saying, sorry: I can't join you because I am not able.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them appear far superior to their actual capabilities. 

One compelling reason for this exaggeration is the inherent nature of advertising itself. Advertisers aim to capture attention and create a desire for their products. To achieve this, they often employ persuasive language, captivating visuals, and emotional appeals that can distort reality. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might feature a model with a dramatically transformed physique, implying that using the product will guarantee similar results. However, the reality is that such transformations often require significant effort and lifestyle changes, which the advertisement may not fully disclose. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on selective information and strategic omissions. They may highlight specific features or benefits while downplaying or completely ignoring potential drawbacks. For example, an advertisement for a smartphone might emphasize its sleek design and advanced camera capabilities, but it may fail to mention its limited battery life or susceptibility to overheating. By presenting an incomplete picture, advertisements can create a misleading impression of the product's overall value. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often fall short of providing an accurate representation of products. Their primary objective is to persuade, and they achieve this by exaggerating benefits, employing selective information, and omitting crucial details. Therefore, it is essential for consumers to be critical of advertising messages and to conduct thorough research before making purchasing decisions.",
"As is known to everyone, there are lots of advertisements has been created druing this medium period. some people think advertisements make products seem as the same as they really are.  on the other hands, some people don't think so. In my point of view, i agree the statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are. The reasons why i agree are as follows.
    First of all, advertisements become more creative and interesting, owing to attract more buyers to buy their products. If the advertisements are really boring, there is no one will be persued to buy their products. What's more, there are lots of products in the world. Some sellers suffer more pressure about how to get a important role in this market, As a conquence, the advertisements will show more information about such good products they sell. Even though, the products are really not as good as advertisements present. Worst of all, it's a negative cycle. Lots of advertisements follow this kind of trend to gain more profits from consumers. 
    By way of conclusion, i totally agree this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In order to attract more buyers and then earm more money, the advertisements make products which become more amazing and creative, but not they really are. It is a really negative cycle in our society. However, many people don't pay much attention about this issue. What a pity it is.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a well-rounded education fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems from multiple perspectives. By studying diverse subjects, one develops a wider range of analytical tools and frameworks. For instance, a student who has studied both history and economics can better understand the complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors that shape historical events. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the world. 

Secondly, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek individuals who can learn new skills and adapt to evolving demands. A broad knowledge base provides a solid foundation for acquiring new skills and knowledge, making individuals more adaptable and employable. For example, a person with a broad background in science and humanities can easily transition between different fields, as they possess the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary to succeed in diverse environments. 

Finally, a broad education cultivates a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of knowledge. By studying different subjects, one realizes that knowledge is not compartmentalized but rather interconnected in complex ways. This understanding fosters a sense of intellectual curiosity and a desire to explore the world with an open mind. For instance, studying literature alongside philosophy can reveal the profound influence of philosophical ideas on literary works, enriching one's understanding of both disciplines. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge, preparing individuals for a successful and fulfilling life in a complex and ever-changing world.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old question of breadth versus depth arises. While specialization offers profound expertise in a particular field, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This is because a diverse intellectual foundation fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to think critically and make informed decisions. By understanding concepts from various disciplines, one can analyze information from multiple perspectives, identify biases, and draw more comprehensive conclusions. For instance, a student with knowledge in both history and economics can better understand the causes and consequences of economic crises, considering both historical context and economic principles.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. In today's interconnected society, individuals are constantly encountering new challenges and opportunities that require diverse skillsets. A well-rounded education provides the flexibility to navigate these challenges and seize new opportunities, as individuals can apply their knowledge from different fields to solve problems and innovate.
Finally, a broad knowledge base allows for a more holistic understanding of the world. By studying various subjects, individuals gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of different disciplines and the complexities of human society. This understanding fosters empathy, tolerance, and a more informed perspective on global issues.
In conclusion, while specialization can lead to remarkable achievements in a specific field, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers invaluable benefits. It cultivates critical thinking, adaptability, and a holistic understanding of the world, ultimately preparing individuals for success in a complex and ever-evolving society.",
"I agree to the statement where I believe most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are. Such statement can be supported by my own personal experience and my friend's experience. 
	Through media, such as magazines and televisions, many products are advertised. Many of the products seem very cheap and good in quality from the way they are presented. One day, I was watching an advertisement channel where they sold a hair removal spray. The advertiser showed how anyone can remove their hair by spraying on their hair and simply wiping it by a towel. The show also showed a person remoivng her hair through wax very painfully, trying to get across the point this product is better than any other method to remove hair. Strongly convinced by the advertisement, I bought the spray and excitingly waited for its arrival. When the product arrived, I tried on the spray immediatly. I was dissapointed when the spray did not work at all. I kept spraying and wiping but my hairs never came off. From this experience, I realized how advertisements make product seems much better than they really are. 
	Another example that supports my opinion is through my friend's experience. My friend ordered a cosmetic magazine since she was interested in buying some make-up for herself. When she took a look at the cosmetic magazine, she was surprised at herself for not buying all of her cosmetic through magazine. The product were much cheapter and seemed better than buying at stores.  She told me how she was never going to buy cosmetic products at Sephora or other cosmetic stores. My friend ordered a pack of lip sticks through the cosmetic magazine and she was busy bragging about it to her other friends. However, when the lip sticks arrived, they were so much smaller than they appeared in the magazine. The lip sticks were only about 1 inch long. From then on, my friend learned to never order anything through magazines. 
	From these two experiences described above, it can seen that most advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are. We should all be causious of the advertisements and look into it carefully before buying any products.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old question of breadth versus depth arises. While specialization in a specific subject offers profound expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual versatility, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to connect ideas across disciplines. By exploring diverse fields, we gain a richer understanding of how different subjects intersect and influence one another. For instance, a student with knowledge of both history and economics can better analyze the impact of historical events on economic systems. This interdisciplinary perspective allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of complex issues.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. Exposure to various subjects encourages individuals to question assumptions, analyze different perspectives, and develop independent thought. By engaging with diverse ideas, we learn to evaluate information critically and form our own informed opinions. This ability is crucial in today's rapidly changing world, where critical thinking is essential for navigating complex challenges.
Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters a more well-rounded and adaptable individual. In a world where careers are constantly evolving, having a diverse skillset and a broad understanding of different fields can be invaluable. Individuals with a broad education are better equipped to adapt to new challenges, explore different career paths, and contribute meaningfully to society.
In conclusion, while specialization can lead to deep expertise, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more holistic and enriching educational experience. It fosters intellectual versatility, critical thinking, and adaptability, making individuals better equipped to navigate the complexities of the modern world.",
"Young people are different from before. In the past young people were working for own community; however many things to have fun with friends especially in Tokyo. In my opinion, I am agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I have two reasons that support my position. Young people started to hang around in big city not near by their house and they can't think about other people.
 There is a city whose name is Ikebukuro. This city has many arcade park, caraoke, poll barn and so on. The city is best place to hang out or date for young people. I also the one who think same way with young people think. In my ecperience, I was always haging out with friends at Ikebukuro and come back home late. At that time I have never interested about my community. I was thinking that It isn't fun at all if I help my community. Is there any benefit if I do so? I couldn""t understand people who help their community. I think there must be more people who think same way with mine. 
 I think young people became more selfish than before. They work just for their lives, not for their family and they can't feel any love from family. This leads to hanging around only with friends. In my experience, I was always hanging around with friends. I couldn't feel any love from my family. Therefore, I couldn't have any interested about my community; however, people helped me during examination season for college. They gave me a lots of informations about college and especially my family helped me to find a college which fit my preference. I was doing this job by myself but I could feel love from my family and people who are in my community. 
 In conclusion, young people startet to hang around only big city not to involve their community and became more selfish than before.",
"""The new Generation"" is a very critisized topic these days. Young people often give out the example of a modernised generation who care about nothing but temselves and how to stay entertained.

Even though young people  always seem to be preocupied with themselves, they do care, in a way, about helping their communities. It is true that they  do not show it as much as older people do but that does not mean that this new generation does not care about helping their communities. After all, they are part of their community ,so by helping it they end up helping themselves.

For example, young people will tend to help their communities  by making it seem more enjoyable. They will plan numerous activities for different events, like trick or treeting and costume parties for Halaween. By doing that they entertain people of all sorts of age : children will be happy as well as their parents who will enjoy spending time with their family. Now of course this example might not be very revealent for older people who think that by helping the community you must decrease the number of unemployments, help the elderly, organise charity events...but  younger people, are not always aware of the importance of these sorts of problems, which is why they do not give it attention. This does mean that teenagers do not care about these social problems but it will take more time for them to understand how important they are for the community.

By saying that ""young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"", we give out the impression that they are spoiled kids who do not give attention to their environment. That is why i disagree with this statement. Both teenagers and children help their society by not even noticing. For example, they are aware of not throwing their rubbish on the streets. By knowing that they help decrease the pollution rising in our world today. Of course, they would not be helping their communtity as much as adults do, but it is a fresh good start that proves that this lack of care of the ""new generation"" is not always true.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This exaggeration is achieved through a variety of techniques, including selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals. 

Firstly, advertisements often present only the most positive aspects of a product, carefully omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might highlight its sleek design and advanced camera features, but fail to mention its short battery life or limited storage capacity. By focusing solely on the positives, advertisements create an idealized image that may not reflect the actual user experience. 

Secondly, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. They may use heartwarming stories, celebrity endorsements, or catchy jingles to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. These emotional connections can overshadow rational considerations and lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on sentiment rather than practicality. 

Finally, advertisements often present unrealistic portrayals of products and their benefits. For example, a commercial for a weight loss product might feature a model with a dramatically transformed physique, suggesting that the product can achieve miraculous results. In reality, such claims are often exaggerated or even misleading, and consumers may be disappointed when they fail to achieve the advertised outcomes. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can provide valuable information about products, it is important to recognize that they are designed to sell. Most advertisements employ techniques that make products seem much better than they really are, relying on selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals. By being aware of these tactics, consumers can make more informed purchasing decisions and avoid falling prey to exaggerated claims.",
"In our modern societies, individualism keeps growing. Because of this fact, the communities need more and more help. But nowadays, the generation of video games seems more preoccupied by itself than by their commuunities. Does it mean than young people do not help their communities anymore? In a first part, we will discuss the growing individualism, and in the first part, we will see how  young people help their communities.

To begin with, we live in societies led by capitalism. This system encourages the personal achievement, through the American model of the self-made man. Everyone has to fight for himself to realize his dreams, while at the same time, old or handicaped people, or even the family are alone, or in a bad situation. So, should young people sacrified time they would have put into their career to help these communities or not? 

However, our societies are also the societies of all the associations. In the last decades, many associations are born, living to help the communities. And it is often young people that work in them. For instance, the Association Habitat et Humanisme that help people to find a house by gathering funds is mainly composed by young people. Furthermore, more and more Schools and universities develop associations that help people. Helping communities has become a common fact for students. I also think that giving time to helping communities becomes more and more a strong argument in front of a manager, when a young people is looking for a job.

To conclude, I would say that I clearly disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping communities. 
In the contrary, I think they give more and more time for them.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance and a sense of boundless possibilities, it is inaccurate to suggest that older individuals are incapable of experiencing joy and fulfillment. In fact, life's journey often brings with it a deeper appreciation for the simple pleasures and a more profound understanding of what truly matters.
One key difference between the experiences of youth and older age lies in the perception of time. Young people often feel a sense of urgency to make the most of their fleeting youth, leading to a focus on immediate gratification and adventure. This can manifest in a pursuit of novel experiences, travel, and social connections. However, older individuals have often had the opportunity to accumulate wisdom and perspective over time, allowing them to savor the present moment and appreciate the beauty in everyday life. They may find joy in simple activities like spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or engaging in quiet contemplation.
Furthermore, the notion that older people are inherently less capable of experiencing joy ignores the fact that life's journey is filled with both challenges and triumphs. While youth may be associated with a sense of invincibility, older individuals have often weathered life's storms and emerged with a resilience that allows them to find happiness even in the face of adversity. They have learned to appreciate the value of perseverance, gratitude, and the importance of cherishing the relationships they have cultivated over time.
In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic and inaccurate portrayal of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree spirit, older individuals often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and a greater capacity for finding joy in the simple things. Life's journey is a continuous process of growth and evolution, and the ability to experience happiness is not confined to any particular age group.",
"In my opinion this question needs to be dealt with in a differentiated way, there are pros and cons.

A significant argument in favor of the statement is that certain developpments which currently take place, lead to a higher degree of egoism among the people. We live in a world, which globalizes more and more, there is more competition and everything becomes increasingly busy and difficult. One has to face unemployment or lower wages unless you are better than others, one has to dominate others in a certain way. I think this quite general phenomenon gradually leads to a change in social behaviour, which expresses itself for example in a lack of young people, willing to help their communities. 
Furthermore young peoble are in many cases not willing to help in their community for the simple reason that other things are more entertaining. Why should they help older people or do some cleaning job when they could alternatively spend their time playing computer games, watching a series in television or hanging out with friends. Young people aren't sufficiently taught that it can be far more interesting to help others and to improve the community experience.

On the other side there are also some argument against this statement. The existence of a considerable number of organizations in ther welfare-sector and the fact that young people are integrated in these organizations serves as a proof against the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. 
There are religious organizations, sport clubs and political parties which dedicated themselves to the duty of helping in their community and the y have many young members.
Apart from that the civil service is the Germnan alternative to the militarz service. For the period of one year young people can help in there communities.",
"The development of mass media was the beginning of a new era of avertisement. Virtually all companies make use of advertisement using the possibilities given by the new forms of mass media as for example the TV or the internet. I agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

First reason for my point of view is economical. Given the fact that firms take their decisions on the basis of rationality there has to be an economical icentive for them to invest in advertisement. And so it's quite obvious that the firms intend to increase their sales by the way of advertizement. And the consumers are now buying more from the firm's product for one simple reason. The firm's product seems to them much better than it really is. And the firms knowing this fact make use of this by advertizing.

Another argument is psychological. I personally have made the experience that the way one consider the value of certain objects is highly influenced by the way that other people talk about these objects. For example, once most of my friends bought a new video game. And whereas I hadn't liked this certain game a short time before, from this moment on getting this game seemed to be the most important thing in the world. And this process is now linked to the effects of advertisement, because the advertisement for a lot of products is made by very popular people like a tennis star or show master of an TV show. And this effects how people think about the products. The product seems in most cases much better than it really is.

Even if advertisement often conveys true information about a product awakening the interest of the people. I believe that there is mostly a strong effect influencing the people in a way, so that there is difference between the true value of a product and the value the people think. And this means that there takes place an alienation of
the peoples preferences. And from an economical point of view this can't be good for the welfare of the society.",
"The ubiquitous nature of advertising in our modern world leads many to believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products. While it is true that some advertisements employ deceptive tactics, I disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 

Firstly, the purpose of advertising is to attract consumers, and this often involves highlighting the positive aspects of a product. However, this does not necessarily equate to deception. For example, a car advertisement might emphasize the vehicle's fuel efficiency, safety features, and stylish design. While these features may be presented in a favorable light, they are not inherently false. Consumers can still research and compare different models to make informed decisions.
Secondly, many advertisements are regulated by government agencies and industry standards. These regulations aim to prevent misleading or deceptive claims. For instance, food advertisements must adhere to specific labeling requirements and cannot make unsubstantiated health claims. This regulatory framework helps ensure that consumers are not misled by exaggerated claims.
Finally, consumers are becoming increasingly discerning and aware of advertising tactics. With access to vast amounts of information online, consumers can easily research products, read reviews, and compare prices. This empowers them to make informed choices and avoid products that are not as advertised.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may exaggerate product qualities, it is inaccurate to claim that most do so. The purpose of advertising is to attract consumers, and this often involves highlighting positive aspects. However, regulations and consumer awareness help mitigate the potential for deception. Ultimately, consumers have the power to make informed decisions based on their own research and critical thinking.",
"Wether it is better to have a broad or a specific knowledge depends esentialy of the point of view : if you are looking at the society general interest or at the individual interest.

Eficiency is one of the main argument in favor of knowledge specialization, because it is certainly harder to master a great variety of topics than to focus on a narrow topic. Specialization is one of the main reasons of the great achievements of modern Science.  Today's scientists are capable of very complex theories and projects because they are all very specialized. A botanist would not mix with quantics, because he would loose some time in getting the basis, whwn he could have developed a little further a study on a peculiar animal behaviour.
So for Science and more widely for the human race specialization is better.

But as human being and individuals we need equilibrium which is achieved only throught a wider horizon of knowledge. If your goal is self fulfillement then you will be better of knowing a large panel of topics. That is why during our elementary and most of our secondary studies we are studying a large panel of fields in order to get a solid background on which people can build their minds. 
And it is valable even in the scientific world, when some of the most extrordinary discoveries have been made throught interdisciplinar studies. Like mixing ordinary chemistry with biology  you discover the extraordinary possibilities of using one to dicover more of the other.  You  can dicover some intresting molecules in some animals or plants and you can better understand how the brain works if you know chemistry.

I will end this essay by saying that a solid background of knowledge is necessary, and only then you can specialize in your own field.",
"The statement, that advertisments tend to be too euphoric regarding the products value or effectivness, is an ofter heard observation from people consuming todays massmedia.
The reason for a company to spend money on an advertisment is to make the product known to the public and to compete with their competitors on the market. 
If the advertisment is made for a new and innovative product, it is more likely a realistic view of the products abilities, than it is in case the product has to compete in a dense market of similar products. In the later case the consumer is alredy affected by the advertisments of other companys or even own experiences and therefore less likely convinced by a new product. Depending on the market situation the product is facing, the advertisment has to be choosen by the advertiser. The statement, I am referring to, should be made more specific, as a general view on advertisments is not possible in my oppinion.
Another reason why advertisments can seem to be much to confident in a products value but actually are not, is the setting or story told in the advertisment. A vacuumcleaner in front of a beautiful landscape is somthing different from the same vacuumcleaner in a wardrobe. The product is the same only the viewers connection to the advertised product varies. Sometimes it is the consumers imagination that lends him to the conclusion that advertisments are promoting a unrealistic picture of a product and not the advertisment itself.
In the case of products intended to be used by a very young usergroup (kids or teens) the advertisments are more likly to present a better picture of the advertised product that reality would allow them to. The young consumers are more easily affected by such campaigns than older consumers, who tend to be more carefull when relaying on advertisments.
The general understanding that advertisments can't tell the truth is wrong in my view, though the technique to present a product in a better light as it really is, is definetly in every advertisers toolbox.",
"Being Young
  
             There is a common feeling that the best time of our lives are the times that we are young.A human being with its body getting older and older could not be the same person when he was young.It is true that young people enjoy life than the old people,that`s just how our lives are.
              First of all,the main fact is that an old person could not do the things that a young person can do.Instead of knowing how to enjoy life,there are some limits to what an old man can do.
              Secondly,as a person gets older,his needs and interests changes parallel to his age.Although there are some people whom want to live his earlier life,the commonly fact is that an old person does not want live like he used to live when he was young.Anyway, a person lives his most exciting moments when he is young and being old is starting to share his expressions with younger people.It is a time of life that a person starts to think more than he used to.Young people enjoy life and old people live to earn a living for themselves.
                Young people as considered between the ages of 18 and 30;must know how to enjoy life.A person must live the things that he has to live.A young person has to learn not to collapse after some bad moments he lives because there is more to enjoy in life.It is also enjoyable being young because people start to have more responsibilities as  they grow up.
                 In conclusion,it is great to be young in our world and it is great to be old also.The most enjoyable parts are the earlier parts but living is all good when a person knows how to live it.",
"In today's rapidly evolving world, the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a subject of much debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Exposure to diverse subjects allows individuals to see connections and patterns across disciplines, enabling them to approach challenges from multiple perspectives. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might better understand the causes of historical events, while a scientist with a background in literature might be more adept at communicating complex scientific concepts. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base promotes adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. As technology advances and industries evolve, individuals with specialized knowledge may find themselves limited in their career options. However, those with a broad understanding of various fields can readily adapt to new challenges and opportunities, making them more employable and valuable to society. For example, the rise of artificial intelligence has created a demand for professionals with interdisciplinary skills, combining technical knowledge with an understanding of human behavior and ethics. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches our lives and fosters a sense of interconnectedness. By exploring different subjects, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the world and the contributions of various cultures and disciplines. This broadened perspective allows us to engage in meaningful conversations, build stronger relationships, and contribute to a more informed and tolerant society. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge base is more beneficial in the long run. It fosters critical thinking, promotes adaptability, and enriches our lives, ultimately making us more well-rounded individuals and contributing members of society.",
"I will support the idea that young people are more happy than older people.

The first reason is that people in their twentys for example usually have less health problems and more energy. They are at their physical heights, strong, and beautifull ! They can go out late at night and wake up early the next day without feeling too much pain.

Another reason is that young people still have hope. Hope in a brighter future for the world, hope in a brighter future for themselves. They beleive, and they are theoritically right, that everything is still possible in the world and in their life, and this contributes greatly to their happiness. Every day  a new life can begin. As a counter example, I have a friend, 40 years old, who has been a technician for the twenty first years of his career, despite the fact that he didnn't really like technical jobs. He always thought his job was just for a living and that he wouldn't do that all his life. But recently, when he wanted to finally change job and work in business, he just couldn't find a single employee that aws interested in his profile. He was very depressed about the idea of spending the rest of his life doing something he didn't really like. Whereas for young people, it is easier to change job.

Finally, young people have less reponsibilities than older people, therefore they are less likely to suffer from stress than older people.  Their job, their familly life, and their belongings are not as important as they will be in their future.

  Plus, their decisions usually involve only them, therfore increasing the satisfaction that they can get from life. They can more or less decide according to whatever they feel is good for them, without having to find a compromise with a loved one or childrens. For instance, if they do not have a family, they can decide to go and work abroad if they have a great opportunity, which is not so easy to do for someone that lives with his wife or husband.

As a conclusion, even though there are many benefits to growing old, young people enjoy more life than older people. But after all, being young is in people's minds !",
"I disagree with the statement that  young people enjoy life more than older people do. I believe that there is no requirement of an age for people to enjoy their life. I do not claim that young people do not enjoy their life, instead older people do too. 

Those who support this statement would say that when people get old, their enthusiasm dies and due to old age health problems set in. But I would say that once we are old and free from the daily work schedule we actually get time for ourselves, your families, and our friends. It gives us the time to pursue our hobbies or passions which we could not attend to when we are busy earning money. We enjoy our grandchildren more than we might have enjoyed our children. We have the time to take care of our health, which we probably neglected when we were young and busy with work. We are more mature and more tolerant due to our experiences, and things don't affect us as much as they did when we were not so understanding in our youth. We enjoy our hard earned money after working during all our youth. We have the time to go for holidays with family and see the world which we didn't see earlier due to lack of time. In youth due to lack of time we miss out on a lot of things which we can come back to later in our old age. In our youth, we are immature and things that we enjoy are more materialistic. Whereas, in our old age, having known the world and become wiser we know that true happiness lies in being a good human and being content with what we have. 

Old age brings with it, a lot of good things besides a few bad ones, of course.  But being old does not mean that one cannot enjoy it. There is rarely a time in your life when you are fully content with the way it is going and when all is actually well. It is all about the attitude that one should adopt to enjoy life not the age one has. Old people enjoy life as much, maybe more, than young people.",
"I agree that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are. They want to sell their product as soon as possible. there is some problem .Most  of the people  belive like that advertisemnet. What are most cause about that. 

	First cause, when they sell somethink to people , first they think about that to how can we sell to product. THey decided to who need this product. For example if somebody is obezit, who eats lot os food. They told the person to we have your medicine or your way how to lost weight. The person is gickly believe that , because she or he needs to lost weight. If the person sees on the televion like this advertisement, the person without think call product home.

	second cause is,the people without see already order the product. They just see on the televison. This reason is when the sellerman seela his or her product they show a diffretn kind of product. For example I many years ego Got alot of weigt and than I thougth abou that. How to lost weight. One day I was watching on the televion I see one adversisement . This time they have very good merchants. I believed and I ordered this product. Because I see on the person , who walk around the room. there days later my order came and that I disapointed about that , because It was realy really unconfortunable.
	I reackon when the people hear the abot product they should be search on the internet or somethink like that.It is very important , because may be when you order a product You could give you credit card number already . Maybe they can get more tthan money. I think most of the adverstisement lies because my mother always this one, ""if your merchants good you do not have to call somebody to coming aroud me and take my product. If you are good already all the people take you product you do not have to sell youself as much as possible"". In the end I want to say somethink If you go to the down in see you have to screamed beacuse you are failed .",
"I believe the correctness of this statement varies greatly from one community to another. 
If am to answer this question considering Turkey, the country I live in, I would still say the answer depends on different socio-economical classes in Turkey. However, I agree that the majority of young people in Turkey nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
One thing that can be said is that the more educated a young person is, the more time s/he devotes to help the community. When we look at the uneducated youth of Turkey, we see that they spend their time doing simply nothing. A large percent of them is unemployed and they don't have the sense of helping others in the community since they are the ones who need help in the first place. 
However, when we look at the youth in the universities, we see that they are more concerned about the problems in the community and possible ways to solve those problems. So, from this point on, I will concentrate on the educated young people. 
When I look at my university, there are some people trying to help the community, and some people who simply don't care. Devoting time to help the community is not really common, though. The heavy courseload forces people to plan their time effectively, and what is included in the plan is, most of the time, the things which have practical benefits. People simply don't have time to enjoy the moral benefits obtained from helping others. 
Actually, a person can devote time to help other people only when his/her own needs are fulfilled, so that s/he can enjoy the moral satisfaction and respect from others in the community. However, in a community where it is hard to fulfill the needs of oneself, it should not be expected of young people to devote their time to help others in the community. Mor",
"I strongly think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.There are three major reasons for this.
	First, just imagine if you were an economist,and you have very specialized knowledge about economy. Just ask yourself waht consist the Economics. In fact, the subject ""economics"" consists of many other  academicsubject like world history, mathmatics, psycology, and so on. It could be said to another subject s too. No academic subject can exist itself alone. So, if you study hard, it naturally lead to the fact that you hae broad knowledge of many academic subjects.
	Second, when you have conversation with other people, which kind of people do you think is more fun to be with? The person who talks about just one topic again and again, or the person who has various knowledge about various subjects. I think the answer is simple. It could be said that the person who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects has better ability of communication with others, and the ability of communicaiton is really important point to live this world. To be succesful in any field of society, its an essencial element.
	Third, to have various knowledge can improve the quality of your life. When you travel Italy, and you are familiar to the history of ancient Rome, you could spend more excitingtime. If you can calcurate quickly and efficiently, it would be really convenient in everyday life. Thus, various knowledge can be your tresure.
	In conclusion, some people say that by specializing in one specific, we can get deeper knowledge. I think its true. However, does everyone needs deep knowledge? I dont think so.",
"Actually, it is not my belief that it is better for an educated person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In today's changing society, it is far from enough to be just an ""expert"".
	When we watch television or read newspaper, we think that to have an expert talking about a subject is reasonable or even that only the expert has the authority to talk about the subject in public. Based on this psychological effect, we tend to support the idea that the society should produce more ""experts"", so that people will get more reliable information from the media and their lives. However, when it comes to education, it will be a bad idea for the students nowadays. For example, I've always wanted to be an simultaneous interpreter. But being an interpreter requires a lot more than the knowledge about translating.  He has to know ""something about everything, and everything about something"". If he has to go to a conference which is dicussing the oil crisis. He has to know the basic information about oil, all kinds of oil in fact. Therefore, a successful professional shouldn't be limited in the arena of his specialized subject. Otherwise, his success wouldn't last very long. For example, if you are an employee working for an insurance company. The basic rule for you to success is that you know how to sell. That is a skill that involves with a lot of other subjects. You'd better know how the hospital works, so that you can sell your insurance to its patiences. Then you need to know what kind of patients can make protential customers and what kind of patients can not (like those who have developed uncurable disease). So, after years of studing in college, if you know nothing other than what insurance is, you are definitely doomed.
	So, in my opinion, being an ""expert"" is not a bad thing, but what we really need in today's challenging world are people who have their specialization and also the broad knowledge about the nature and the society.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.


Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-ups to food banks, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address local needs. For instance, the recent surge in youth-led climate change activism showcases their dedication to improving their communities and the world at large. These young activists are not only raising awareness but also taking concrete actions to protect the environment. 

Secondly, the rise of social media has empowered young people to advocate for social causes and mobilize others. Online platforms provide a powerful tool for organizing community events, raising funds, and spreading awareness about important issues. Young people are using their digital skills to create positive change and connect with like-minded individuals, fostering a sense of collective responsibility. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From traditional volunteer work to online activism, young people are demonstrating a strong commitment to making a difference. It's important to acknowledge and celebrate these efforts rather than perpetuate negative stereotypes.",
"I agree with this statemant for three reasons.
 Firstly, many young people, even elementary school students, have a lot of things to do after school. Some student have to do their home work, some student have to go to cram school.  They have no time to concern about their communities.
 Secondly, the way of playing has changed. Developing of computer games, for example, young people tend to play inside of their houses. The longer they spend thier free time inside of thier houses, The lesser they spend helping thier communities. 
 Lastly, not only young people, but also society has changed. Young people in thirty years ago, they used to play  on the street, and they had plenty oppotunities to communicate and to help thier communities. Recently, the number of crime in the communities increasing grately. Strees near their house are no more safe place. Neibours are no more reliable.
 Some people will say that there are still young people who helps their community. However, thinking about the increasing number of old people who dieing alone, we cannot avoid admitting the decreasing of young people's time to helping thir communities.
 It is sad, but it is true.",
"I think that it is better to have broad knowlegde of many academic subjects because there are many reason for this.

First, I think if you have broad knowlegde of many academic subjets you will have a better chance for a job in the future life. Companys or firms will search people who have a big knowlegde of many subjects. Also this people have the ability to help in many departments. So for example, if they have had varios ecnomic subjects  they can work in every department of the firm or company.

Secondly if you have broad knowlegde of many academic subjects it is good for yourself. You save the feeling that you have learn a lot and that this what you learned can help you in many situation of your futher life. So for example you can help people which needs any statement from you.

Thirdly I think it is very busy to have many academic subjects because you have a lot to learn. So maybe you haven't got the time to meet your friends, to do some sport activities or something else.

There are also people who prefer it to specialize in one specific subject, but in my opinion I think that these people aren't interested in other subjects and maybe they haven't got the interest to learn. They more likely to meet friends or do sport activities. For these people personality life like the hobbys a sport acativities or meet friends are more important than the broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

In addition, to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject I think because it helps you in many situations as like in your job or personal situations.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibilities, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a simplistic and inaccurate view. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, like exploring new experiences and pursuing passions, may not hold the same appeal to someone who has already lived a full life. Older individuals often find satisfaction in different aspects, such as nurturing relationships, contributing to society, or simply appreciating the quiet moments of reflection.

Secondly, the challenges faced by young people can significantly impact their enjoyment of life. The pressures of education, career choices, and financial instability can create significant stress and anxiety. On the other hand, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and security, allowing them to focus on personal fulfillment and leisure activities.

Finally, the notion that youth equates to enjoyment ignores the profound wisdom and perspective gained through life experiences. Older people have witnessed the ebb and flow of life, learned from their mistakes, and developed a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. This wisdom can lead to a sense of contentment and appreciation for the simple joys of life that may be overlooked by younger generations.
In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain energy and freedom, it is inaccurate to claim that they inherently enjoy life more than older people. The enjoyment of life is a complex and multifaceted experience that evolves throughout our lifespan. Both young and old can find fulfillment and happiness in different ways, and it is essential to recognize the unique perspectives and experiences of each stage of life.",
"I strongly agree on the statement that young people are enjoying there life than older once.

As per the changing of the time the people have to change.In the older days there were be certain restrictions given to stop things tobe done which give lot of happiness.Consider the situation of my parents.They have certain to point out,many restrictions over there life's.The education what my grandfather insist to study,my father continued.But it is different in my condition,i have my own views to which i can and i do probably.

In the same way many cases,consider another example in which older peole are not that much free to their children,as the thing they missed lot of things to share to their parents for example some college situations.But the children now are enjoying each and every moment of their college life with their co-students and sharing the things to parents and commenting.

And the other more is improvement of technology.In olden days there were not any amusement parks,recreation clubs,theatres and stuff like that.But the improvement of technology gave lot of fun over life.The younger people are able to enjoy themselves by going to parks,recreation clubs,parties along with friends and tours.And the tours will give lot of fun along with the information about the places where people are going.

In this way i can give the examples like this to tell many things and the young people are having the ability to do there things of their own with fun,but previously people have to depend on some one to complete any work which they want to do.So i strongly agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people do.",
"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In these days, many companies use advertisement to promote their products for aim of selling to customer. Advertisement  is a kind of persuasion. To idealize their products, they make product focus on human beings' feeling and ration. So, they usually use the idealism, dramatic example, and  demonstration, because those methods is well-acceptable to customers. But, if you use unacceptable felling methods such as the pity, the poor or emptiness, the begging, it may cause terrible result.
For example, imagine that you can see acceptable approach of idealism, proper example, and perpect demonstration in ads and then you get good feeling about that and also you are fond of product. Finally you will decide to purchase that in the end without long-term hesitation. And company use big sport game like super-bowl game or major leage final. You always have watched advertisement during the game, that is, break time. you may concern that why company use breaktime to promote their goods by paying unimaginable money. In contrast to your though, numerous people all over the world watch that big game for just two to three hours. The company knows that it will influence tremendous effect to people who is willing to buy something. At that time, people change their mind to buy ads' goods instead of other product of different company. It causes ptimistic result. Finally company gives free-samples to people on a certain day to demonstrate goods of how excellent goods are. Even in the mall or on the street becasue of crowed the herd. In those examples are shown to us everywhere and evertime when we are in the situation of recognizing except sleeping.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This exaggeration is achieved through a variety of techniques, including selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals.
Firstly, advertisements often present only the most positive aspects of a product, omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For example, a commercial for a new smartphone might highlight its sleek design and advanced camera features, but fail to mention its short battery life or limited storage capacity. This selective information creates an idealized image of the product, leading consumers to believe it is superior to its competitors.
Secondly, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, they create a positive association with the product, even if it is not inherently desirable. For instance, a commercial for a luxury car might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that owning the car will bring happiness and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the product's actual qualities.
Finally, advertisements often present unrealistic portrayals of products and their benefits. Models with flawless skin and perfect bodies are used to promote beauty products, while actors with exceptional athletic abilities are featured in commercials for sports equipment. These unrealistic representations create unrealistic expectations and can lead consumers to feel disappointed when they experience the product in real life.
In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority employ deceptive techniques to make products seem more appealing than they actually are. By selectively presenting information, appealing to emotions, and creating unrealistic portrayals, advertisements can mislead consumers and distort their perceptions of products. It is essential for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"Advertisements of commercial products serve as means of distributing information among consumers. Consumers derive information about products' quality, terms of use and price via advertisements. Nonetheless, it may be argued that advertisements open a door to abuse their feature of distributing information in the sense that they may make goods seem much better than they actually are.

First of all, it should be seen that any possible misusage of advertisements is due to competition among firms which try to survive and generate profits as much as possible. For this particular reason, it is obviously unreasonable for a firm to make misleading advertisements. Because, this will consequently yield the result that experienced customers, who bought the product by trusting the advertisement, will not buy again the same product since the firm and its products are not reliable anymore. Therefore, it is irrational and unexpected to come across with misleading advertisements as long as firms tend to survive for long periods of time. 

Furthermore, regulatory agencies exist in most of the countries to prevent such advertisements if they are ever brought up by extremely myopic and short-sighted enterprises. Thus, advertisements, which are supposed to be deceiving, can rarely fill the legal requirements.

As a conclusion, number of advertisements, which are supposed to make products seem much better then they really are, should be expected to very low, if they exist at all. Because, such advertisements are neither wise and profitable options for firms in the long run nor legal in many countries.",

While it's true that some young people may prioritize their own pursuits, many actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives tackling social issues. From organizing environmental clean-ups to advocating for social justice, young people are utilizing their passion and skills to create positive change. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their dedication to addressing global challenges.

Furthermore, many young people volunteer their time to organizations that support vulnerable populations. Whether it's tutoring underprivileged children, assisting at local food banks, or providing companionship to the elderly, their contributions make a tangible difference in the lives of others. These acts of service not only benefit the community but also foster empathy and a sense of belonging in young individuals.
In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about an entire generation, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which young people contribute to their communities. From leading social movements to volunteering their time, they are actively shaping a better future. To truly understand the impact of youth on society, we must look beyond generalizations and appreciate the individual contributions that make a difference.",
"I agree with this opinion : Most advertisements make products seem much better thant they really are.  There are 3 reasons why I think so.
     The pictures of advertisements are usually very attractive.  For example, the picture of the apartment's part of the room.  It always seems larger and brighter than they really are.  However, the customer actually visit the apartment, they say the room is not as good as they expect.  Also, sometimes it is not as clean as the advertisement picture.
     The goods which the company sell are also more simple than the company says such as music players.  The company sings the productons of them can record and play more clear that what the productions used to be.  However, sometimes there is a no  differance between the new ones and the old ones except the price.
     There is one more reason here.  Our imaginations help to think better when we see the advertisements.  If we watch the commecial on TV,  we get the good impression at first even thou we don't know how the products really are.  Then we think we want it, but when we see the products with our eyes, we disappointed with it.  It is because the products are not as attractive as our imaginations.
     Because of these 3 reasons, I think most advertisements are not as good as than they really are.  They commerce just good point of the products, but we need to have critical thinking.

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to specialize or broaden one's horizons is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual flexibility, enhances critical thinking skills, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas across different disciplines. For example, a student with a strong foundation in history can better understand the social and political context of scientific advancements. This interdisciplinary approach encourages creative problem-solving and fosters a more holistic perspective.

Secondly, a diverse range of knowledge promotes critical thinking. By encountering different viewpoints and methodologies, individuals learn to analyze information critically, identify biases, and develop well-reasoned arguments. This ability to evaluate information objectively is crucial in today's complex and rapidly changing world.
Finally, a broad education fosters a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of human knowledge. By exploring various fields, individuals gain a broader perspective on the world and its challenges. This understanding is essential for tackling global issues such as climate change, poverty, and inequality, which require interdisciplinary solutions.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base provides a more valuable foundation for intellectual growth and success. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, individuals develop critical thinking skills, foster creativity, and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. This approach equips them to navigate the complexities of the 21st century and contribute meaningfully to society.",

"The goal of an advertisement is the increase of a product's sale and the company's profit. It therefore seems a given that the item of sale is presented as positively as possible. Not all prodcuts, however, can live up to the promises they make.
Bank loans, for example: very low interest rates and easy pay-back means give the impression of fast money without much hassle and very little responsibility for the customer. Rather hidden are tricky issues such as securities or initial down payments, which have to be provided on a standard basis. The focus of the adds does not disclose the actual costs of such loans. 
Therefore, a viewer can easily be led to believe that lending money from the bank is quite inexpensive, whereas she or he may in fact be running up a huge amount of debt when all aspects of loan taking are considered. In particular, the maths between income, basic living expenses and costs for a loan, are usually very revealing.

Another illusion that advertisement reinforces is that of looks. 
Research regularly shows that particularly young women feel pressurized by the appearance of persons in ads. A recent study found that even women who work in the advertisement industry and who know of the unhealthy lifestyle of most of the female models as well as the use of computer techniques such as photo-shop, believe that their bodies are not the way the should be. 

One area where the claims of the ads and reality appear to be more balanced is medication: mandatory guidlines on dozage and recommended consultations with medical doctors seem to convey more caution than many of the ""easy does it'' and bubbly commercials for general products.

Finally, something also needs to be said about the consumers: while much of the responsibility for creating illusions obviously vests with the advertising industry, the consumers should also be held to a certain standard of scepticism and critical review.",
"I disagree with the statement made ,I strongly feel that young people do spend some time by helping their communities .they also play a primarilly role in this issue thereby doing the work ethusiastically .

Primarily, i would state that nowadays the young people are advised in their  schools and colleges to their communities to grow & they give lots of valuble suggestions based on their experiences .thus the young people with this information use their creativity to help the community.

Furthermore, the communities & their organisations have started conducting plenty of  meetings  then previously done .Thus they also state the current problems in the community and nurture the future generation with valuble suggestions based on their experience and they also encourage the young people to paricipate in these issues .

Consider an example, which i have experienced during my young days .Once there was meeting arranged by our community and a was problem stated regarding helping of disabled people in the community and adults gave some money to help them .But we young people helped these disabled people by helping them to cross the roads ,and also assisted them whenever the needed some help.

In addition to the example mentioned above ,we also had another accasion where we were given some job by the community members ,i.e they had problem regarding the increase in pests like mosquitoes & we helped them by pouring sand in places where water tends to stagnate ,as stagnant water is the main cause for breeding mosquities .

Finally, I state that Nowadays young people spend enough time to helping their communities than done before .thus i conclude by saying that the young people play a primary role in the developement of a community",
"If young people enjoy life more than the old people do?there may be many defferent answers according to defferrent people's indentity exprences.In my opinion,I don't think that young poeple enjoy their lives more than old ones,because of several reasons following:
 
First of all,Young people have less time to enjoy their lives compraring to the old people.People spend their early life on studing,working and many other things that can promise a goog future.Old people in the other hand,almost retire from the busness that calling hard-woks,so they have a plenty of time to enjoy the live.

Secondly,young poeple,sometimes,dont't really undterstand what is the best of live,so they always spend their time on something they don't really like.When they think they are enjoying the live,actually,they dont't really feel happiness.  For example,many young people believe that big city can make their dreams becaming true.They going to there to look for good job.But always they can't get the job they want ,because there are so many young poeple there and the competing is very sharply.But the old men who have a lot of live exprences may be more clare whith what they want really and spend their time to get it ,to enjoy it.

Finnally,old people have less pressures than yuong people.Their  yuong children have grown up,their career has completed,their life push has slowdown,so they have a release haert to enjoy the life.Yuong poeple, on the contrast,have varis of pressures,such as childen,career and even the old parents.They have many tast to do.They don't releasing heart to enjoy the life.

In a short word,the old people may enjoy their live more than yuong people do.It is fair,because they have spend for their enjoyment during their erlier lives.",
"The main purpose of the advertisement is not only make customers to understand products but also make products look nicer and better. Thus, I totally agree with the following statement. All people would have experienced the power of the advertisement a lot of times. I have a few examples to support my idea. 
	When I go to the mall, I see the new products each time. One of them is cell phone. I watch the TV almost everyday, mostly advertisement, I see the new cell phones everytime. So many abilities of cell phone lured me to buy it, such as camera, mp3, recorder, mirror, and walky talky. Although I thought I will going to use it for sure, I did not use those abilities not much as I thought I would. Because those abilities were less than I expected. I will buy digital camera rather than camera phone, mp3 player rather than mp3 phone. I was lured by watching advertisement. I did not see the inside of cell phone but only believed in my vision.
	Everytime I go to watch movie, I always decided to see the movie that has interesting poster, or has interesting short scene from the advertisement. There are so many times that I regreted. I realized that advertisements are important as much as qualities of the products. I would not think that movies can not success without the advertisements.
	The purpose of the advertisement is lure customers. There are people make interesting advertisement, and that's what they are for; make it look better and nicer. The market of the advertisements is growing, sometime company spend a lot of money to make best advertisement rather than make better quality.

"I completely agree with the statement.
We are in the consumis time, that means that people buy things and industrial products not when they really need them, but only for the pleasure to buy something new and have the pleasant sensation to spend the money in those modern supermarket, which you can find everything new in. In this way a person always feels to be original and ""modern"", not ""ancient"" like people that surroand him or her. With this new conception of the money and about the way to spend them, the productors of objects that are every day used (such the mobile phone, the tv, the shoes and so on ) invent always new way to make those products attractive. In this way people feel obliged to buy the last thecnological mobile phone for example, otherwise the seem to be out, but not for the really need to have it. And what is the best way to let their new products be known all over the world? 
The answer for this question is simple and everyone know the answer. Simply the answer is: advertisement. 
We can watch the tv or only look at every journal to verify this sad truth. If the advertisement is the quicker and most seen way to spread news about an industrial product, in order to let people know my last innovations, why don't use this simple way of diffusion according to the imprenditor's volonty?
And in order to sell more pieces of a product, so that this imprenditor can get much more money, what about making an advertisement annunce putting lies in? 
It's not a true lie, but only a manner to pubbicize the product in a wrong way: not like an object that you can buy only if you really need it, but like an object that you can't live without it.
For this reasons advertisements make product better they really are.",
"I totally agree that most advertisements often make products seem and sound  better than the  actually are. There are meany reasons why adevertisements seem that way. 
First, because those product  makers want to target and attract the  biggest amount  of  people, they will try their  best to ""putify"" their  products by using colore and  mainly by using attracting  words. Mostly the will  use words and expressins  like ""99% Guranteed,"" and "" it will change your  life"". One  good  example of  a  product  the  uses  colorful attracting  words if a beauty product called ""Aveeno"". On it written, ""recomended by dermatologiestes.it  will make, not  it  makes, your  skin very soft, it will  whiten it and  will give  you a  beautiful skin for a  life  long."" My wife have  been using  this  product  for a  preiode  of  few  years and  I never  noticed any changes.

Asecond reason is  that dvertisers use tricky and  misleading words like ""help"", and ""aim"" or 99.99%, never 100%. By using these words , they  make  their  product  more  convencing to the customers and consumers, especially  hopeless people  who tried  other product, but did  not  get any  positive  results, will run after thrie  products. As an example, I have  been complaining of teeth  [problems for few  years and I tried different kinds  of  toothpaste. I was attracted by  one  of those  kinds called called ""Crest Senstivity"". I used this  product for a long time, but my teeth  never  get better unti I was seen by a  dentist who clarified to  me that the  use of a  toothpaste may help in some  xcases  but  not in all. After he  examined  my  teeth he  said  that I had a  bad  infection  which  can  not  be  treated  merely with any of the  tooth paste brands. Instead  he  said I  need to  have a  clinic treatment  at  different  sessions. My visit  to the  dentist confirms  that product advetisers  use fake and  misleading words  which  do  not  give  enough  information to the  customers.

To conclude, in the  field  of  advertisement and  promotion, advertisers use colorful words and  expressions, fake and  misleading words and umproven facts  just  for the sake  of  attracting  customers and consumers  and  selling the  biggest amount and  making  more  money.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products and services. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them appear far superior to their actual capabilities. This tendency to embellish reality is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to purchase. 

One compelling example of this exaggeration is the ubiquitous use of airbrushing in beauty advertisements. Models are often digitally altered to achieve flawless skin, perfect proportions, and unrealistic features. This manipulation creates an unattainable standard of beauty, leading consumers to feel inadequate and more likely to purchase products that promise to achieve this idealized look. Similarly, food advertisements often employ techniques like close-up shots and vibrant colors to make dishes appear more appetizing than they truly are. The reality is that the food we see in these ads is often styled and manipulated to enhance its visual appeal, leaving consumers disappointed when they attempt to recreate the dish at home. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals to sway consumers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, advertisers attempt to associate these positive emotions with their products. This tactic can be particularly effective in targeting vulnerable demographics, such as children or the elderly. For instance, toy commercials often feature children laughing and playing with the advertised toys, creating a sense of joy and desirability. However, the reality is that the toys may not provide the same level of entertainment or engagement once purchased. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately reflect the qualities of products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits to entice consumers. The use of airbrushing, emotional appeals, and other manipulative techniques creates a distorted perception of reality, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based on unrealistic expectations. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"I don`t agree with the following statement: 
 young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
I know nowadays we are all selfish and we don`t have enough time to help others or to think or to take care about social conditions where we live in, but I know that some friend of mine spend their free time taking part in events community.
Helping others or taking part in social events brings gratifycation you feel usefull for the society.
Many young people are involved in collective activities in different places of the city.
Mainly these activities have the aim to help someone or to improve something which should be better.
Secondly I think many adults in my city don`t believe in young people and I think the governament should give voice and space avaible for all, in particular for younger.
The crime and deliquency rate`s increased especially between the younger, and I think  the adults shoul be their teachers.
The teenager is not the only one guilty.
Finally I think the current daily life is faster than sooner and the living condition for young people are not better nevertheless I know many people help their communities.
It will be better to believe in young people",
"There's a truth that some advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, but there are still some of them are the same as they really are. It's difficult to directly say that whether most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, there are only a few people make advertisements seem much better than the advertisements really are nowadays, and also in the future.

Advertisements are used for introducting the stuffs what are expected to sell, so if the advertisements makers show people some real advertisements. There will be many people who are glad to buy. There won't be a problem that if people have known the things well, because after they have spent their money once, thet will believe these advertisements, and maybe some of people will regard them as their favourate, whatever which kind of advertisements they are. For example, food, tools or electrical equipments. They'll be sold well, and the sellers will get a lot of money in the future because their honest in the advertisements. So it's good to make advertisements as real as they are.

We have to believe that nowadays there are also some sellers who make advertisements much better than they really are. At first, a lot of people don't know the advertisements a lot, so maybe the sellers can increse the prise and earn a lot of money in the beginning. Later, after everyone has known the truth of the advertisements, how can the sellers get money continue? They cannot!

All in all, I think that not most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently involved in community service is a generalization that overlooks the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various avenues. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-ups to food banks, youth groups are actively participating in initiatives that address local needs. For instance, the 'Youth for Climate' movement has mobilized young people worldwide to advocate for environmental sustainability, demonstrating their dedication to creating a better future. Moreover, many schools incorporate community service into their curriculum, encouraging students to engage in projects that benefit their neighborhoods. This early exposure to service fosters a sense of responsibility and empathy in young people. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to make a difference. With the rise of social media and online platforms, they are able to connect with others and raise awareness about important issues. For example, young activists have used social media to organize protests and campaigns, amplifying the voices of marginalized communities and advocating for social justice. Additionally, many young entrepreneurs are starting businesses that focus on social impact, addressing issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. These initiatives demonstrate the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of young people who are committed to making a positive impact. 

In conclusion, while there may be some young people who are not actively involved in community service, it is unfair to generalize about an entire generation. Young people are actively engaged in various forms of service, demonstrating their commitment to improving their communities. From volunteering to activism and entrepreneurship, they are utilizing their skills and resources to create a better world. It is important to acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of young people who are making a difference in their communities.",
"""Young people nowadays"", this is a dangerous expression to start a thesis. It carries a negative tone, a musty ""In my days people knew how to behave..."" flavour, older than ancient Greece. It is hard not to disagree with anything starting that way. 
Refering to the statement as such, one has to differenciate. There are a lot of young people engaged in activities dentrimental to society. This certainly should change. And there is never enough time spent in helping the community, most social organisation are working at the very limits of their resources and barely scratching the surface of the problems they try to remedy. But that is true for all age groups. Furthermore social engagement is not considered very ""cool"" by most young people. But there are notable exeptions and a lot of sport groups, boy scouts or Christian (or any other religion) youth organisations won't work without the time and efforts devoted by teenagers and people in their early twenties. So I think the main problem is to recruit more people into social engagement, regardless of their age. Society has to change it's attitude towards helping the community to achieve this, not just the young generations.
Therefore I do not agree with the statement as stated above.",
"In the realm of education, the age-old debate between breadth and depth of knowledge continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization in a specific subject offers undeniable advantages, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This essay will explore the merits of a well-rounded education, arguing that it fosters critical thinking, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge.
Firstly, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. Exposure to diverse subjects allows individuals to analyze information from multiple perspectives, identify biases, and develop nuanced arguments. For instance, studying history alongside literature can provide a deeper understanding of social and cultural contexts, while exploring science and philosophy can foster critical evaluation of scientific claims and ethical dilemmas. This holistic approach equips individuals with the ability to think critically and solve problems effectively in various fields.
Furthermore, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. As technology advances and the job market evolves, individuals with specialized skills may find themselves ill-prepared for new challenges. However, those with a broad understanding of different disciplines can readily adapt to new situations, applying their knowledge and skills to solve problems in unfamiliar contexts. For example, a graduate with a degree in literature might find success in fields like marketing or public relations, leveraging their strong communication and analytical skills.
In conclusion, while specialization has its place, a broad education offers a more enriching and adaptable foundation for success. By fostering critical thinking, enhancing adaptability, and promoting a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge, a well-rounded education equips individuals with the tools necessary to thrive in an increasingly complex world. Therefore, it is undeniably better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",

	This is a very competitive world, everyone wants to get the bests for themselves. They want the best job, best car, best house, and etc. So, everyone is trying their best to get what they want, they won't think of others, but only think of how to bettle with others to prove that they are the best.

From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change activism, exemplified by Greta Thunberg's movement, showcases their dedication to environmental sustainability. These young individuals are not only raising awareness but also taking concrete actions to protect the planet. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to benefit their communities. Many young entrepreneurs are launching businesses that create jobs and contribute to local economies. Others are using their technological expertise to develop innovative solutions for social problems. For example, the development of mobile applications that connect volunteers with those in need demonstrates the ingenuity and social consciousness of young people. 

Finally, young people are actively engaged in civic participation. They are voting in elections, advocating for policy changes, and engaging in political discourse. This active citizenship demonstrates their commitment to shaping the future of their communities. By participating in the democratic process, young people are ensuring that their voices are heard and their values are reflected in the decisions that affect their lives.

"Most of the young people and old people enjoy their lives. Some people might say that young people do not enjoy their lives because they have to study hardl and find jobs for their future. However in modern society most of them enjoy their lives more than the older people. Older people have to earn money for their kids and have responsibility for their own families, but young people have various ways to play such as computer games and TV. They can also have much food if they want because of their parents.


   Older people might have their own kids and families. They have to feed and educate their kids. To do this they have work hard, pay tax, and give some money to their kids. Some older people can not exercise for their health because of the tight schedule and hard working. Older people do not seem to enjoy their lives.


   Technology process has made a lot of things to play. Young people get their own self-phones or  PS2 from their parents. They will also go to amusement park for fun with their friends. Old people might not have thier own self-phone when they are young. It is easy to have what they want for young people like food. Young people is enjoying their lives.


As you seen above it is definitely sure that young people enjoy their lives more than older people. Young people can just sit down and study for their future or some may be playing computer games with their friends on oline. They have more various ways to play. I hope young people study hard.",
"Some companies show products not over they really are. On the other hand, most companies show thier products over thire thinking by using advertisements. I think that it is possible to occur some problems because of differences of the thought between company and customer. I think that if company tell a truth on advertisement, the company can get aome advantages, the belifes of customer and can continue to manage for long time. Therefor, I disagree that statement.
	First of all, what company can get advantage by tell a truth is the belife of customer. It is difficult for company to get the belife because normaly the customer do not belive others and even company. For example, we do beginning of something, we become really carefully. we listen many explanation not to have mistaking. After that, we rely on the things. Like that, if company make customers belive, customers continue to buy products. Therefor, it is important for company not to show over thire thinking by advertisement.
	Secondly, not to show over images of products means  that companies can continue to manage for long time.",
"i disagree with the statement. i know that older people works hard and have to take care of the family, bills and other stuff. but student's also have to study, obey parents and young people's life is limited. 
	I born in Korea. and my parents told me that i should be happy because I do not have to work. but they do not know what young people are going through. This was the typical life of mine before I come to U.S.A, go to school 8 , come home 3 : 30, go tutoring from 4 until 8, and then go to another tutoring. when I get home it's 1 a.m. Maybe older people think that we live happy life we have no life for fact. and reason that we don't have life is because of adults. We are told to do what our parents tell us to do. they tell us if you study hard you will have better life later. 
	Moreover, younger people have limited life  young people cannot work if their parents don't allow them to work or drive. olders life are not they can do whatever they want. Their life is made by their choice. Older can chose wether they want to work or not. nobody is going to say, "" hey!!! you have to work! "" because they are adult nobody can control them. they have their own right to be that way. However, think about the young people like high school students. They have to study for SAT,PSAT, ACT, TOEFl ... etc. we also need to worry about friendship, look, love, and college payments. So many thing to worry about and the pressure of the parents.
	Young people do not have the freedom of choice and they are attached to lots of tests to worry about. i bet old people don't think that test is enjoy of their lives. For these reasons, the statement should change like this ""Old people enjoy life more than younger people do"".",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibility, claiming that they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is an oversimplification. Both age groups experience unique joys and challenges, and the notion of enjoyment is subjective and multifaceted. 

Firstly, young people often have the advantage of physical vitality and a sense of limitless possibilities. They are less burdened by the weight of past experiences and societal expectations, allowing them to embrace new adventures and pursue their passions with unbridled enthusiasm. For example, a young traveler may find immense joy in exploring a new country, unhindered by the constraints of a career or family obligations. However, this youthful exuberance can sometimes be fleeting, and the lack of life experience can lead to impulsive decisions and a lack of perspective. 

Conversely, older people have accumulated wisdom and a deeper understanding of life's complexities. They have weathered storms and learned from their mistakes, developing a resilience and appreciation for the simple things. The joy of an older person might lie in the quiet satisfaction of a successful career, the love of their family, or the peace of mind that comes with financial security. For instance, a retired teacher may find immense fulfillment in mentoring young minds and sharing their knowledge. 

In conclusion, it is impossible to definitively state that one age group enjoys life more than the other. Both young and old experience life in unique ways, with their own set of joys and challenges. While youth may possess a certain carefree spirit, older individuals have the advantage of wisdom and perspective. Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that varies greatly from person to person, regardless of age.",
"It is rather frequent for people to buy a good or service, but find out that what they buy is not actually what they see and like in the advertisements. This is because, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 

  The main reason for this situation is the companies that provide these goods or services. Sellers of products naturally always try their best to sell more, and thus increase their profit. In order to achieve this, advertisements are made use of as they are the most effective way to attract the attention of consumers and as a result increase the quantities sold. Mostly, the products are showed rather differently from the real products in advertisements, as many properties of the products are exagarated. The best example to this kind of advertisements are the products showed in the television and sold only by ordering using the telephone. The consumers do not actually have the chance to see, touch and investigate the products themselves. They can only decide to buy the product considering the properties described on the television. Nevertheless, frequently consumers become dissapointed upon seeing the thing they bought when it is delivered. This is because the real product is not as good and useful as it is described in the advertisements. 

   The reason why I reached to the conclusion that advertisements make products seem better than they really are is my personal experience. One day, while I was watching television with my mother, we saw an advertisement of a cream that helps people to lose weight. They showed many women that had used this product and were really satisfied with the result. Therefore, although the price was a bit high, we decided to order one and try as we both wanted to lose some weight. We started to use the cream regualry as soon as it was delivered. However, obviously we did not really lose weight. On the contrary, the cream made my skin rather unpleasent. Then, we both decided to be more careful in such things again.

In conclusion, owing to my personal experinece, I can definitely say that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Actually, a person can easily reach this conclusion with thinking the reasons behind as well. As a result, people should be very careful in buying products and not trust to the advertisements completely.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplification to assume that older individuals lack the capacity for joy and fulfillment. In fact, both age groups have unique experiences and perspectives that contribute to their overall well-being. 

Young people often enjoy the freedom and novelty of new experiences. They are exploring their identities, building relationships, and pursuing their passions. The world feels full of possibilities, and the excitement of the unknown fuels their sense of adventure. However, this period can also be marked by uncertainty, pressure to succeed, and the fear of making mistakes. As individuals mature, they gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world. They develop resilience, wisdom, and a greater appreciation for the simple things in life. 

Older people may not have the same physical energy as their younger counterparts, but they often possess a wealth of knowledge, experience, and a more profound sense of gratitude. They have weathered life's storms and learned valuable lessons along the way. They have established strong relationships and built a foundation of stability and security. This sense of accomplishment and contentment can contribute to a deep sense of fulfillment and joy. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not solely determined by age. It is a matter of perspective, personal values, and the ability to find meaning and purpose in one's experiences. Both young and old have the potential to live fulfilling and joyful lives, each with their own unique advantages and challenges. It is important to recognize and appreciate the diverse ways in which individuals experience and navigate the journey of life.",
"When was the last time you spend just an hour helping another person?  All of us --not only young peopole-- may think about this question, because nowadays we've became more selfish, completely dedicated to our own lifes and sometimes we don't realize that there's a lot of people around us that are less priviledged and need help. Therefore, it's true that now we don't give enough time to helping our communities.

I think that there are several factors that explain this behaviour. Firstable, society doesn't recognized this contribution, but instead of it, you're better if you get two majors, an excellent job, buy a car and a house and live with all the conveniences. So, we spend our time trying to get these goals and forgetting about the community.

A second factor could be that nowadays the time is the most appreciated value. The companies pay us for our time, we spend a lot of time working, and free-time is very important for us. Working on a ONG project will take us a lot of free and not revenued time, so we prefer not to do it. To illustrate this point I can talk about my own experience. While I was working for an advertising agency I tried to spend more time helping the others, I felt that I had to do it. I contacted to 'Aldeas Infantiles' (a childhood project) and I spent a year teaching children and playing with them just Friday afternoons. 
In the end I decided to quit the project because I worked at the office son many hours than then I didn't have enough time to see my boyfriend and my family. I realized that time was too much important if you don't have enough.

In short, although it's difficult to have enough time for all, we have to try it and spend maybe just an hour a week helping our community.",
"Are you the kind of person who wants to know every thing about a thing or a thing about every thing?. In our life many people have to decide in between having broad knowledge of many subjects and specializing in one subject. In my openion i believe that having broad knowledge is better than specializing in one specific subject. However, there are advantages and disadvantages.
	First of all, by having broad knowledge of many academic subjects you will be a well round-educated person and have alot of skills that you can use in your daily life. having many subjects makes a person well round-educated one who is able to understand alot of things that face him in his life. For example, if a person had a psycology course he would understand the acts of his teenage children. Moreover, by taking many academic subjects you might have some skills that help you in certain situations. For example, my cousin used his french when he took his mother to a hospital to recieve a medical attention in france. So, taking many academic subjects is a good choise if a person want to be a well round-educated one and to have skills that might be useful in his daily life.
	Furthermore, because of its waste of time and distraction ,having a many many academic subjects might be considerd as a disadvantafe. These subjects make a person spend a lot of time on them because ther are many of them and he must gives them the same attention. Also, they distract the person from foucesing on his own major subject which he uses in his future job and let him spend his time on subjects that he do not need in his job. So, a personn should think before 
	In conclusion, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has its own advantages and disadvantages, but since the advantages have more weight than the disadvantages, I think that having vroad knowledge of many academic subjects is the best choice to make.",
"It is often said that having broad knowledge in the acdemic subjects is better than having specific knowledge in the specific subjects. Some people might agree with this statement because broad knowledge help people in the diverse field, in particular, they need urgent help. However, I am against of the idea of broadening knowledge in the acdemic subjects instead of specializing in one subject because these day requires specialist in one part and those who have a skillful in one realm also exact well in other field.

To begin with, it isn't surprising that many specialists dominate in these day. As one might expect, in present Korea, most of success people are specialist, such as doctor, lawer, and computer engineer. That's because today' society gives high value to specialist. For example, people who diligently work without any skill in his field could recieve admit from people in the past. But nowaday, these people are considered to unability. My father just diligently work in his field, but after all he fired from his companies in the IMF depression season in the Korea. All things considered, having diverse knowledge isn't helpful for these day people, especially youth and the younger peoples.

In addition, it is commonly observed that specialist in one field can easily obtain other related knowledege from their field. For instance, when I was an elemetary school student, I hated language. Thus, I didn't understand other subjects. As a result, I could try to study hard only Korean subject. By wring and reaing in Korean, I could increase my knowledge about not only Korean, but also other subjects, such as sociology and math. After all, I was interest in all subject, and I could study well in all subjects. 

In brief, I strongly believe that students should specialize in their meirt field. That' s because it leads to be a specialist and b",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, creating an idealized image that often fails to reflect reality. 

One compelling reason for my stance is the use of deceptive marketing techniques. Advertisers often employ selective information, highlighting only the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight loss product might showcase a slim and attractive individual, implying that using the product will guarantee similar results. However, the advertisement may fail to mention the potential side effects or the need for a healthy lifestyle alongside the product. This selective presentation creates a misleading impression of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals and persuasive language to manipulate consumers. By evoking feelings of desire, excitement, or fear, advertisers can create a sense of urgency and convince viewers that they need a particular product. For example, a car advertisement might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, suggesting that owning the car will bring happiness and adventure. This emotional connection can overshadow the actual practicality and functionality of the product. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often present a distorted view of reality. By selectively showcasing positive attributes and employing emotional appeals, advertisers create an idealized image of products that rarely aligns with their true nature. Therefore, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of these manipulative tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"I do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. To my mind, the main reason for it is that older people have acquired a strong living experience. Indeed, because they have lived longer than younger people, they have experimented more with different lifestyles and thus know which one is likely to give them the most enjoyment in life.

In addition, older people may have more time to spend; younger people are likely to experience the stressful beginnings of work and education. Thus they have more time to enjoy life: when one is busy working, one cannot spend time enjoying life. In what ways then can older people manage their time in order to enjoy life more ? Older people can fulfill their spiritual needs more easily as their thoughts are more trained. This is why is may be easier when one is older to study serious matter and read more difficult books, and why it is so much more difficult for younger people to concentrate on hard subjects. Put simply, the younger people tend to be more easily distracted by basic needs and so are more likely to be disturbed by them too.

For example, I could cite my grandfather who says that he has come to the best moment of his life because he can now enjoy his present life more than any time before by reading and reflecting on his experience. Hence my idea that younger people may have more physical energy than older people, but older people have equally or more mental energy. 

Thus, older people enjoy more life than younger people do because the former knows how to employ it's time to enjoy life best on the contrary of the latter which doesn't.",
"I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, an
advertisement is in the between reality and imagine. For example,  if some medicine company advertise made by rabbit blood by showing the ingrediants and the real processing methods, nobody don't want to buy or sell. I know  this example seems like over-expression; however, let think about reality, it totally depend on mild imagine. The mild imagine is cute and humorous. The second reason that I agree the topic is that. The main objective of advertisement is to persuasive buyers or costomers. It is the most important to advertise. At this point, to get agreement some product become more beautiful and gorgerous using new high technology such as potograpic technic, various grapic technic with computor. So the development technology is creasing to stimulate customer's view. As a results, many company use the effect and then the results make it to be see most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This exaggeration is achieved through various techniques, including selective information, emotional appeals, and unrealistic portrayals.
Firstly, advertisements often present only the most positive aspects of a product, carefully omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might highlight its sleek design and advanced camera features, but fail to mention its short battery life or limited storage capacity. This selective information creates an idealized image of the product, leading consumers to believe it is superior to its competitors.
Secondly, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging, they associate these positive emotions with the product. For example, a car commercial might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that purchasing the car will bring similar joy and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can overshadow the product's actual functionality and value.
Finally, advertisements often present unrealistic portrayals of products and their benefits. A beauty product commercial might showcase a model with flawless skin, suggesting that using the product will transform anyone into a radiant beauty. However, this image is often achieved through extensive makeup, lighting, and digital editing, creating an unattainable standard that can lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction.
In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often rely on exaggeration and manipulation to make products seem more appealing than they truly are. By selectively presenting information, evoking emotions, and creating unrealistic portrayals, advertisements can mislead consumers and distort their perceptions of products. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertising messages before making purchasing decisions.",
"I agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
There are a lot of advertisments of many organizations that are looking for young people to help the community and this organizations apply for many different kinds of jobs.
For example when I listening to the radio or when I watch the television I see many advertisments about companies that try to increase these kind of jobs. If there are so many advertisments, it`s will mean that they need other people, especially young people.
Secondly in my country I know some boys and girls who help their community in their free time,but it`s not so common. I have just known two or three persons who have done that in their life.
I have many friends and of course they study or they have a job, but they also have a lot of leisure time. In my opinion the problem is that young people in thei free time prefer for example to go to the gym or to go home just to relax,or to go to a pub to have a drink. It`s a question of choices, it`s not that they don`t have time to dedicate to their community.
For example If during the afternoon you go along the streets in the center of the city you will see that is crowded:there are a lot of young people that are having a walk,to go shopping or just for fun.
If the same day you go in a company who works for the community it`s not so crowded!! You can do some different job for your community and you can help your community in many different way. Furthermore it doesn`t take you so much time,you can work just an hour a day,or just two times a week.
I think that it`s would be better if there was much more information about this, for example more advertisment in the schools or in the universities.But nowdays I don`t think that young people give enough time to help their communities.",
"Someone says that the art of advertising it's the art to tranform something you usually don't even think about into something not only desiderable, but indespensable to fulfill your intimate needs and desires.
Given that as an assumption, it's easy to understand how ads' experts make use of the finest and more sophisticated techniques to present their products and services to the general public of consumers.
It's common sense that  "" it's the first impression that counts "". This is even more important when it comes to the market. In particular when the average, not outstanding, characteristics of a product or of a service must face a competitive environment to gain market shares and to build long term trust by their customers.
This is why a ""little lie"" at first sight is necessary, most of times even accepted and comprehended by the customers, as it is in love affairs.
Techniques are uncountable and may vary significatively according to the category of product or specific item presented to the public.
One of the most used technique is to show a picture of the product which is far more attractive than the product itself.
Guess who has never been disappointed by the slimmy sandwich that comes out from a Mc Donald's packaging comparing to the beautiful, inviting and gnammy picture that you can see behind the server while you are waiting in the line?
Someone calls them ""sweet lies"" or ""innocent lies"", that could be tolerated and accepted if we are still talking about sandwiches or candies but when it comes to products or services that can tremendously affect people's life and health, then it comes the need for a more critical approach to the discussion.
In many countries, advertising agencies have developed over the year a code or a set of regulations to discipline the way advertising is conducted. Even if these efforts are worthly of support I personally think that the consumers are the final judges and they will determine the success or the failure of a product also according to the gap between how it's presented and how it really is.
They say "" lies sometimes are sweater than reality "", probably it's true but we all know that lies have short legs in the end.",
"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. In my opinion, this is because of the change and developement of our sosiety.
	In the past, a lot of people had done agricultural industries, which need a lot of help and group works. Farmers need to help each other to gather the crops and raise thgem .However, as our industires develop, a lot of people started to have service industries or manufacture. which requires less helps, and more competition among the individuals. Because of these, a lot of young people seems to forget about the importance of helping their comminities and care only about themselves. 
	These industrial change also changed young people's opinions.  Long times ago, many people  thought that it's their duty to help each others. However, many young people now a day thinks it is waste of time and money to give even little helps to their community with out reward. For example, long times ago, if we had poor neighbore who is having a hard time, a lot of people tried to help them with out expecting the reward. However, lots of poors in our community suffer because no one voluntear to help them. Because of the change of the opinion, a lot of young people are neglecting to do even small acts to help ous community.
	Urbanization had a lot of things in our community, including the opinion of the people. As our society started to require more and more competition to survive, a lots of people thinks that the most important thing for them is to care about themselves and success. Because there's to many people who do not even practice simple acts to help our society, I sometime feels like no one is caring about our community.",
"In my opinion today it is more important to specialize in one specific subject. Each field of science has developed very fast and branched out widely during the last 100 years. Today it is not even possible to have knowledge about each part of a scientific area. For example the area of physics can be devided into hundreds of different parts. There is the research of atomic behaviour in contrast to the research of forces that influence movements in our universe. Each new inventions that humanitiy makes becomes more and more complex so that even one single person can't undestand all of it. So it is important to specialize in one subject. 
On the other side a point for a broad knowledge is that all this specific knowledge has to be combined to become an efficient solution. By remaining in the scientific field of physics it can be mentioned that results that came up in atomic research have big influence to research on the whole universe. Thus there has to be a person who recognizes relationships between to diffrent areas of research. 
The problem occuring with this contradictionary ideas is that there has to be one part of people who have to specialize and another part that posses a broad knowledge to have an overview over all fields of researches.
So by choosing the major subject at a university it is evident that the student knows in which position he wants to work in his or her later life. Will he or she go very far into detail of a subject or more have an overview about a subject.
Thus at the end I have to conclude that there can't be a ""yes"" or ""no"" on the statement. It depends on what the person who has to decide likes better. Taking a job with caractaristics of leadership, then decide for broad knowledge. Choosing more scientific detailed work then it is better to have a specific knowledge.",
"It is debatable that teenagers, these days, put the time to help their communities. a rapidly growing number of people think that young people also help thier communities because they are belonged to a wide range of groups and those groups participate in helping communities. In contrast, I strongly believe that students do not spend their time to helping their communities because they not only focus on more difficult  exams, but also tend to become selficient.

   First of all, these days, a lot of difficult exams or tests make students spend more time. Young people study hard to enter more prestigious universities. Thus they focus on studying rather than helping their communities. According to reserch of Chosun-ilbo, one of the leading newspapers in Korea, a number of students who give the seats to the elder or visit the orpanage or silver house. The reserch demonstates that 70% students respond that they do not have enough time to think about other things, instead of studying.

  On top of that, teenagers do not think other people whether they are poor or not. They have tendency of selfcient. In the past, many students consider their communities when communities have special party or festival for reconition of communities, so they frequently help install tools or stages. The best example of this is that my father help making stages of the rural festival of harvesting. He said that at that time, most students who lived in thier communities gave the their hands in order to succeed the festival. On the other hand, when our communities have beach festival every summer, even though our communities ask help assistance, no students emerged the cite to install stages, hence the festival failed. In this respect, at present, students are selficient compared to the past.

  In conclusion, young people do not spend enough time to giving thier hands for communities. The reasons are the stuends concentrate studying more to enter the better universities, and teenagers are more selficient that the past. All in all, a substantial nmber of students study at home, even though the our communities want to need the assistants of teeanagers.",
"In the realm of education, the age-old debate between breadth and depth of knowledge continues to spark lively discussions. While some advocate for specializing in a single subject, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial in today's rapidly evolving world.

Firstly, a broad education fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Exposure to diverse disciplines allows individuals to approach challenges from multiple perspectives, leading to more innovative and comprehensive solutions. For instance, a student with a broad understanding of history, economics, and psychology can better analyze complex social issues like poverty or inequality.
Secondly, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability and career prospects. In a globalized job market, employers seek individuals with diverse skillsets and the ability to learn new things quickly. A broad education equips individuals with a strong foundation in various fields, making them more adaptable to changing job demands and more competitive in the workforce.
Moreover, a broad education cultivates well-rounded individuals with a deeper understanding of the world. By exploring different subjects, students develop a broader perspective on global issues, cultural diversity, and ethical dilemmas. This holistic approach fosters empathy, tolerance, and a greater appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad education offers numerous advantages. It promotes critical thinking, enhances adaptability, and fosters well-rounded individuals with a deeper understanding of the world. In an increasingly complex and interconnected society, a broad knowledge base is essential for navigating the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various avenues. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change activism, exemplified by Greta Thunberg's movement, showcases their dedication to environmental sustainability. These young activists are not only raising awareness but also taking concrete actions to protect the planet. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to benefit their communities. Many young entrepreneurs are launching businesses that create jobs and contribute to local economies. Others are using their technological expertise to develop innovative solutions for social problems. For example, the development of mobile applications that connect volunteers with those in need demonstrates the ingenuity and compassion of young people. 

Finally, young people are actively engaged in civic participation. They are voting in elections, advocating for policies that impact their communities, and participating in local government initiatives. This active engagement demonstrates their commitment to shaping the future of their communities and ensuring that their voices are heard. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From volunteering to entrepreneurship and civic engagement, young people are actively shaping a better future for themselves and their communities. The statement that they do not give enough time to helping their communities is simply not accurate.",
"I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays many advanced technologies are invented.And specially the advertisement or attract people or describe how it is useful, etc. In this world nobody has time to go every time for each items and find out which is best with the quality wise and money wise. Sometimes is helpful that it descibes in the better way. 

In most of the areas we dont know that  how many companies are involved for which specific product and from the advertisement we would able to know that products belongs to which company, how much rate, it is cheaper or not, etc. Sometime we dont know that how to use "" ROTI MAKER"" , so from the advertisement we would able to know that how it use effectively. We would able to know that for the fun, which movies or which album are created and by whom. 
Becaues for the movies and just for album we dont have time to go everytime to cinema and find out.Most of the products are useful and human needs in the advertisement.It is true that sometimes advertisements  describes that products are not really.  

For example that we would like to go for the great and fun tour. And the advertisement is coming that describe cheap and good package for the tour and cheapest rate as well.So we will just pick this oppurtunity and enjoy. So here some other example advertisement describe the location for the new development. So we can able to use this opportunities.From the advertisement we can judge need and judge that how to fulfill the needs. Sometimes in the advertisement some location are described for the food, rent room. So from that we can easily find out needs. But if advertisements not help us then we have to go every place for fullfill the needs. And after choosing some specific place we have to find out that which one is the best. But from the advertisements we will find easily.So advertisements help us in the saving time and fullfil the needs effectively .But in the case of cosmetics and some types of food, just attract people.Some cosmetics are not good for the skin then also some good characters advertise it then its good. So finally its useful in some area",
"Being a 'specialist' or a 'generalist', is a ongoing debatable question. To be the best on one part, is a great job. But the advantages of being a specialist outweigh the disadvantages. The rationale behind is that specialist could be       and generalists are more required in modern sociey.
     People usually respect the person who have great influences on their job. In modern society, however, the person who can deal with many parts are more required. From my personal experiens, when I paid attention to many parts on subject,  I had good grade on test. According to newspapers, in addition, universites suggest that student have two majors. Students who have two magars outdo students who have only one major.  In a bookstore, there are many books about science-humanity and art- science.  In this sense, it is necessary to expand our knoweldge of many academic subjects.     
     Broaden knowledge makes people have a various of view on problems. Stucking on only one subject maybe become narrow opinion. By studying diverse academic areas, people can understand and have many opinions on issues. My profe",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and boundless energy, it is a simplistic view to assume that happiness is solely determined by age. Both young and old individuals experience a spectrum of emotions and find joy in different aspects of life. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming. Additionally, the constant pressure to fit in and succeed in a competitive social environment can lead to stress and insecurity. In contrast, older individuals may have achieved a sense of stability and fulfillment, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves with time. Young people may find excitement in new experiences and adventures, while older individuals may derive satisfaction from quiet moments of reflection, family gatherings, and the wisdom gained through years of living. The joy of raising a family, witnessing grandchildren grow, or pursuing hobbies that have been put on hold for years can bring immense happiness to older people. 

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that happiness is not a constant state. Both young and old individuals experience periods of joy and sorrow, and the ability to navigate these ups and downs is a crucial aspect of a fulfilling life. While young people may have the advantage of physical vitality, older individuals often possess a deeper understanding of life's complexities and a greater capacity for resilience. 

In conclusion, the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people is a generalization that fails to account for the diverse experiences and perspectives of individuals across different age groups. While youth may be associated with certain advantages, older people also have unique opportunities for fulfillment and happiness. Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a personal journey that unfolds throughout our lifespan.",
"Yong people are the futur of a nation and the motor of its grouth and fulfillment.They have always represented the symbol of energy and hope.
Nowadays,young people have to carry a big responsability since elementary school to acheive their dreams.
Since they have many concerns in life,they tend to give shorter time  to help their community.
I think that this matter is due to the interaction of many factors.
The first major factor,is the school busy scheduale.This limits the time given for the young people to join community work so they can't be very efficient since they do not have suffisiant time.
Thes second matter, is the increasing number of video games and intertainment that encourages the young people to isolate themselves in their rooms ans spend hours with technological machines rather than integrate a club or a volonteering association.
This behavior leads to a vicious circle because the more these youngs hide behind their computer screens and games the more they split from the society and the community actions and the more they will be aware of the importance of the community help.
A third factor that can contribute to this situation, is the decreasing of sensibilisation in our societies.This is due to the fact that many media programs don't encourage young people to volonteer work ; instead of this they focus on the role of these youngs as comsumers 
for commertial products rather than productive members for the community.
As an example for this statement,the number of young people who prepare for the casting of a singing show is much higher than the number of youngs who volonteer for planting new trees.
This behavior shows that youngs are influenced by the media more and more.
So to give the future generation a push to communuty work,the educational system,the medias and the parents should gather their efforts and sensibilise their children to the importance of volonteeri",
"We live in a society in which the enterprises and the industries can product everything becouse they reached a very important technological level required  for the production. So their problem is how to sell their product.
To aim this pourpose, industries use the powerful instrument of marketing. They have to convince people to buy their products instead of the products of the others. So they use the promotion to show their products to people through tv, paper, radio etc. Then now some societies have been reached a great visibility and these are well known by people. So costumers known what they want and what they want to buy; they want to buy the producted that they know and that they have watched on tv or seen on a poster on some walls.
But most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
In fact , many less industries, to be able to sell their products, use all the systems to product with the minimun costs. So the quality of their products is not so good. So to hide the low quality they use most advertisements to seems their products better. 
I think that advertisements are important for a society to show its products to people, but i m even sure that if the product doesn t satisfied him, the costumer will not buy it again.
Then i think that this fenomena had brought to another dangerous problem, the counterfait. The societies that promot the counterfaited products use the advertisements of some grat industry to sell goods with a very low quality.",
"I can say I do agree with the statement because the whole industry of advertising has been constructed on the use of psychological tricks that can work to perasuade average people, or more likely some targets of people, to buy a certain product. The characteristics described in TV advertising have often been exagerated because people have to be impressed in first place to remember the name of a product, recognize it in the shop and then buy it. Fact is, that people can effectively realize how good a product is only once they have tried it, but this way the aim of the advertising campaign has already been reached. Now, what are the strategies people can develop to defend themselves from this sort of manipulation? First, they can try to get suggestions from people they know and trust, such as relatives of friends, about a specific product they are willing to buy. Second, they can take advantage of the large number of offers dealers make when they have to launch a new product on the market: this way they can try something new without spending too much money on it. Third, people can always count on some associations, which have been specifically created to defend customers from manipulation of companies` advertising. These are often no profit organization which are giving to give suggestions and assistance when people need it, making sure that the clause ""satisfied or refunded"" is respected. In conclusion I would like to recommend people to always think twice before buying something which looks too good, because, as far as everybody knows, good brands never need advertising simply because their name is always on everyone`s mouth.",
"In today s world there are so many good things that people can enjoy.life is so enjoyable that people never should waste even a minute.time is passing so quickly and people hardly catch up it.according to this thought young people enjoy their life more than older people do.they can be happier than elder people because of the fact that young people have less responsibility for the life and have a adventure feature.

Firstly young people have less responsibilitiy for the life because they are almost single and young.they do not have to think their babies or families.they do not have a obligation to look after their raletives or parents.they only consider themselves.thanks to not having responsibility they can enjoy and live their lives how they want.but older people have to think their families and take care of them.such of  these tasks hinder older people to live their lives properly.they always have to consider their families.

Secondly young people have adventure charactaristics because of their young ages.they have an oppurtunity to live enjoyable and adventurable.young people can do so many things because they have a really good healty to implement.even though older people want to live an exciting life they can not manage it on account of their old ages.there can be health problems in front of them.they can not succeed to live the adventure.

In conclusion the time is so significant that to do things on time.if the age is getting older people begin to delay everything because of the olderness.young people can live a enjoyable life thanks to their youngness.people should stop the time live for themselves.the most reasonable thing to do is living good and enjoyable times while people are young.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them seem far better than they actually are. This tendency is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to buy. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information and misleading claims. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might showcase a person achieving dramatic results in a short period, while conveniently omitting the fact that the individual also followed a strict diet and exercise regimen. Similarly, advertisements for beauty products often use heavily edited images and filters to create an unrealistic standard of beauty, leading consumers to believe that the product can deliver miraculous transformations. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals and psychological manipulation to create a sense of urgency or desire. They may use catchy jingles, celebrity endorsements, or heartwarming stories to evoke positive emotions and associate them with the product. This emotional connection can overshadow rational judgment, making consumers more susceptible to purchasing products that may not meet their actual needs. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be truthful and informative, the majority tend to present an overly optimistic and exaggerated view of products. By employing selective information, misleading claims, and emotional appeals, advertisers aim to create a compelling narrative that persuades consumers to buy. It is crucial for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"although there is alittle time for young people, because of the high amount of reponsiblities , works , and maybe we can say schools (if they were not graduated)  any one can order his time and hime self to get the benefits by doing alot of thing in ashort time like studying , working , and helpeng their communitien or famillies , but with out ordering time the person  will lose the ability of working well , the person will not have time that he cannot do any more works .


                Ordering time is the best way to relax and to have time for every thing . so, the person will do alot of things like finishing his work , then having time to study , after that he will have the time to see his parents , relatives , and friends and ofcourse he will be able of doing any thing with them , as what i had observed and saw from my friend . he was ordring his time will . so, he done alot of work that i was unable to finish, he was going to his secondry school , then after finishing his classes, he was going to work with his father, after that he was taking care of  his brothers , at last he  able to set with his parents and help his communities . as aresult of ordering his time.

                On the other hand , with out ordering time the person will lose time and he may lose alot of work , like what was happened to one of my friends , he was wasting his time ,  for that he wasnot able to see and help his communities . as aresult from having no time at all . he was going to his school in the morning , then when he comes back he was going into his bed , then he was wakingup from bed in the midnight .so, his life was not organized .

"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to connect ideas and concepts across different disciplines. For instance, a student with a strong foundation in history can better understand the social and political context of scientific advancements. Similarly, an understanding of literature can enrich one's appreciation of art and music. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of complex issues. 

Secondly, a broad education equips individuals with greater adaptability in a rapidly changing world. In today's job market, employers seek candidates with diverse skills and the ability to learn new things quickly. A broad knowledge base provides a solid foundation for acquiring new skills and adapting to new challenges. For example, someone with a background in both science and humanities might be better equipped to navigate the ethical implications of emerging technologies. 

Finally, a broad education promotes intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. When individuals are exposed to a wide range of subjects, they are more likely to develop a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore new ideas. This lifelong pursuit of learning is essential for personal growth and intellectual fulfillment. 

In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It fosters interdisciplinary thinking, adaptability, and a lifelong love of learning. By embracing a diverse range of academic subjects, individuals can become more well-rounded, intellectually curious, and better equipped to navigate the complexities of the modern world.",
"For the decades young people have been considered to be more willing to enjoy life than older people do unlike in ancient time when it was common sense that you could not enjoy life until you had reached a certain age.How can we explain those statements

  One thing is for sure ;young people tend to seize each day because even in his early age an human being is fully aware of his fragility and on day he will die like everybody else.One could argue that applies even more to older people but i truly believe that this feeling is fundamental in the mind of a youth.
  I do believe that young people enjoy more life and i think that it is the consequence of the desire of a teenager or a young adult to break free and to be in charge of everything when it comes to his life.Therefore because it is the first time that they have the opportunity to live fully they enjoy life like they will never
again,paradoxically enough it is enjoying your life that makes you forget after a certain lapse of time what it is to really enjoy life.With time you tend to take everything for granted and you realize one day that your missing the simple pleasures that you used to crave about.
  Growing up is an hard time for everyone;it is the time when you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do.In this time of insecurity usualy young people are smart enough to make the best of what they have amd to take advantage of anything that might happen to them.

To get somewhere in life one has to assert itself and in order to do so one has to be mature enough that is why i believe that w you are older you are able to enjoy life in a whole different way.",
"While we are studying it is good to know what should I learn. Should I keep working in a subject that I already master or shoud I developpe a wildspread culture ? On one side I could specialize in order to become one of the best in what I am doing but having no abilities to recycle myself in another suject, while in the other hand I can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill.

A lot of scientific developpement wouldn't have happened if scientist just focused on one subject. For instance, even if Einstein improve the way a viewing physics, he wouldn't have been able to developpe his theories if he hadn't mastered mathematics. Usualy greats intellectuals have a broad knowledge that give them a new way of seeing their specific subject. So in many ways both assertion are complementary.

Personaly I am a very curious person. For me all knowledges are good to fulfill my intellectual curiosity. Therefore I found it interesting to fly from one subject to another that to study one field that would allow me to become the best in a subject that I only few can understand. For this reason I believe that it is ""better"" to have broad knowledge. It is more social.

However our social environment and our society enhance expert. If you want to be hire by company, wathever you are doing, you need to be good at it. That the reason why school and university are providing student with a very precise knowledge. You can easily find cours of developpement economy or in  french Middle-Age litterature. 

Our culture is driven by experise. At any cost, you have to master at least one subject. In my view this attitude is dangerous to culture. Culture is diversity, therefore one shoud seek for a broad knowledge, rather than a specific subject.",

While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial, fostering adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world. 

Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. In today's rapidly evolving world, careers and industries are constantly shifting. Having a diverse understanding of various subjects allows individuals to readily transition between fields, explore new opportunities, and remain competitive in the job market. For instance, a student with a broad background in humanities, sciences, and technology might find themselves well-suited for careers in fields like data analysis or policy research, which require interdisciplinary skills. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. By exposing oneself to different perspectives and disciplines, one develops the capacity to analyze information from multiple angles, identify patterns, and draw insightful conclusions. This ability to think critically is essential in navigating complex issues and finding innovative solutions. For example, a historian studying the French Revolution might draw parallels to contemporary political movements, gaining a deeper understanding of the forces driving social change. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base allows for a more holistic understanding of the world. By exploring different subjects, individuals gain a richer appreciation for the interconnectedness of human knowledge and the complexities of the world around them. This holistic perspective fosters empathy, tolerance, and a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and perspectives. For instance, a student studying literature alongside history might gain a deeper understanding of the social and political contexts that shaped literary works, enriching their appreciation for both disciplines. 

In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters adaptability, critical thinking, and a more holistic understanding of the world, equipping individuals with the skills and perspectives necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing and interconnected world.",
"In essence, I totally agree that a broad span of knowledge of many subjects is better than specialization in one subject.


A broad knowledge span of many academic fields contributes to the overall scholarly status, or level of education, of a person. The world  we live in  revolves around everything we can perceive from science to literature to general knowledge. For example, a physicist who can only talk about physics and the very technical areas of his field of study is, at least to me, very difficult to be called a scholarly person. It is true that he may excel in his own field of specialization but he will find it to earn respect from people in the society in general, partly because his lack of knowledge of 'other' subjects implicitly implies his disregard for the people  engaged in these 'other' subjects. To me, this physicist can not be called an educated person.

In my opinion, no one field of specialization can evolve and flourish solely on its own. After all, whatever ideas, however abstract, that are involved in that field are developed and perceived by human beings who live in the real world that comprises of all different things. It is inevitable that even the most abstract of ideas in one field should have the slightest association to another idea most likely in another field. Since these can be linked in some way or another, it is apparently condusive to know other fields in order to see these links and perhaps also to better the field of specialization.

Another advantage of a broad knowledge span is different approaches and perspectives to viewing a problem. Different academic areas implement different ways of thinking about problems. For example, maths mainly adopts logic and reasoning, while literature may use a more elegant and artistic style to viewing the world. Realizing this should make a person more flexible in solving problems in general and better understand the things around us, or concepts in his field of specialization, in multiple perspectives.

The above re-emphasizes the fact that single specialization is not desirable.",
"There is an old saying, ""Do not judge a book by its cover"". It is true and applies to everything and everywhere in the world. It is impossible to see what the content of the box is only by looking at a box unless a person has an uncanny ability to do so. A woman with luxurious clothes eating in an expensive restaurant might not be rich because she might have borrowed the clothes from her friend for a day and somebody else was paying for her food. Same as the advertisements. Since the purpose of the advertisement is to sell products, it is inevitable to describle products better than they really are.
	Every product is covered with some descriptions and pictures on it. In most cases, the pictures are not exactly same as the real content. For example, one day, I went to the store to buy something to eat. Every food looked great to me since I was hungry, and the pictures on the covers looked really delicious. I bought a bunch of instant food and tried one of them at home. I put frozen pasta in a microwave, and  when I took it out from the microwave to eat, I was greatly disappointed and frustrated. Although the picture on its cover had big chunks of meats and creamy sauce on softly boiled noodles, the actual food looked totally different from the picuture.
	From this example, it can be concluded that it is necessary for food companies or advertisement companies to make advertisement with exaggreational expression or pictures to sell them. I bought the frozen pasta since its advertisement looked great. If there were two kinds of frozen pasta with two different covers with the frozen pasta and the other one with deliciously cooked pasta, what would people prefer to buy?",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertising accurately reflects the quality of products, I strongly disagree. Most advertisements, in my opinion, tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks of products, creating an unrealistic and often misleading image. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of hyperbole and emotional appeals. For instance, a commercial for a new type of shampoo might claim that it will make hair “silky smooth and unbelievably shiny,” even though the actual results may be far less dramatic. By using exaggerated language and focusing on emotional desires, advertisers can create a sense of urgency and convince consumers that they need their product. 

Furthermore, advertisements often selectively present information, highlighting only the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential downsides. A car advertisement might showcase the sleek design and powerful engine, but fail to mention the poor fuel efficiency or high maintenance costs. This selective presentation of information can lead consumers to make uninformed decisions based on a distorted view of reality. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately portray products, the majority tend to exaggerate their benefits and downplay their drawbacks. By employing hyperbole, emotional appeals, and selective information, advertisers create an unrealistic image of products, leading consumers to make purchase decisions based on misleading representations. It is important for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertising claims before making any decisions.",
"I agrees that it is better to board knowledge in one specialized specific subject.They are many reasons to claim for the second option because to have board in one specialized subject we can know the deep concept in that subject.

I did not prefer boarding knowledge of many academic subjects cannot bring much concepts in all subjects.When we r specialized     in one subjects we can apply the concepts in the real world.By studying about the different subjects some people cannnot know the concepts in their aware subjects.Most of the people are intersted to do specialization in one subject because some willl show more interst in their specialized subject.

If people is forced to do the academic subjects he will show the preference in this intresting subject.But knowing of the different subjects come may confused by the concepts they did not know the concept is specified in that subject.Doing job in one concerd subject is our aim.

By studying about one specilized subject one can grasp many ideas  form that subject.by know tooo may subjects is waste because we cannot grasp the concepts in different subjects.The familiar in one subject make theman a scientist.

In conclusion, doing the specialised in one subject is better.By knowing one specialised subject  we can challenged to the real world by our concepts. We can tackle the subject more and more.We can apply the fundamentals and we can invent many many kinds of concepts in that field.So for these reason i support specializes in one subject is better.",
"I am a young person and I am working for free in the catholic community of my hometown. So I have a good idea of what young people do to help in their communities. Because of this, I am convinced that the statement is wrong.
I know many young peolpe which are helping in the catholic community. There are many holiday camps for children which are organized by young people in our community. There is also a monthly meeting of this people. New games or special festivals are organized by this group of young peolpe. Many peolpe do not recognize this work. It is not so obviously like beeing a trainer of a children soccer team.
But not all young people are working in a community like me. I believe this is because working in communities is first of all not very honorable. Many people do not even care about the community work. Communtiy work will be noticed the first time by them, if nobody does it anymore.
Second, community work is not very attractive to young people. The most people, working for free in the community, are very old. But it is not much fun for any teenager to work with seniors. If their friends spend time helping the community, most of the young people will have a great plessure to help their communities - togehter with their friends.
And it is also a problem that most of community work is not for the youth. Young peolpe do not see the neccessarity to help their community, because the community work does not take effect in their allday life.
Overall, I am convinced that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities. Furthermore, I believe that they do more at this time then in the past.",
"In fact, I disagree with the statement. Why? Because the Internet.
	
	When the Internet haven't been built, there are more interaction between people. So you can see many young people in their community to care about the community.  The Internet is so popular nowadays, those young people in public occasion might disappear, but they have been using their way to take care of the community. For example, young people can set up the community in the Internet. If the residents in the community have some issue to discuss, they can enter the visual community to change their
information or give advices. Communicating by the Internet is  faster and more powerful than the traditional face-to-face method.Everyone in the community has access to the informaion immediately after these information was post in the community of the Internet. And they can react it right away.  The government can know the informaion sooner than before and they can adjust the policy about the city. 
	
	Moreover, young people do not always sit in front of the computer. In my community, many young people volunteer to help the elderly people in the community. I, for instance, make a routine to clean the house beloning to theelderly people whose child are far away the community. Sometimes, I also serve as the tutor of the orphans in the orphanage. My neighbor, James, also do the same thing with me and we all feel satisfied after helping others. Of course,
there are many young people like us in our community.
	
	Based on the preceding points I made , I can conclude that the new generation does help their community both viturall and pratically.",
"I like to see advertisements, especially on TV.  There is a variety of advertisements (i.e., TV commorcials) .   Some advertisements look like a TV drama; some advertisements look as if it thretes us to buy it.  It is the company selling podusts who produces the advertisments for the products. There is almost no exception on the fact, I think.  Thus, I personally agree with this statements.

Need less to say, advertisments are made in order to encourage consumers to buy products.  There is no wonder that a company trys to show its product better as much as possible.  I believe that it introduce its produt better than real.  When I was a child, I watched advertisement for an air plane toy.  In the advertisement, I was the plane flying the air.  At that time, I was so impressed and asked my paretent to buy me.  My further bought me it one day.  However, I was so disapointed with the plaine, since it did not fly!.  My further also was dissapointed at seeing me being sisapointed.  I have never trust advertisements since then.  


Recently, I enjoy advertisements as a kind of fiction of products.  I believe that advertisement is a kind of presentation to express what product a compaly wish to make.   Thus, I agree with the statements.",
"Most advertissements make products seem much better than they really are for many reasons.                                                                                     I agree because  they  have to increase the number of clientele, sale, and more   competitive. To maintain the products more valuable they have sometimes use strategies to keep the clientele with same enthousiasm.  Therefore  have obligation to imput more money in commercial. Population in the USA is Capitalist and very  exigeant.  The fact it spends  lot of money to buy certain articles,  becomes intolerant .Therefore advertisements need  all time  make products more attractive to increase  constanly the clientele. Like that the compagnie will able to put more money in the developement of the organism:  formation , research and increase their budget.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to account for the complexities of human experience. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and a sense of limitless possibilities, older individuals possess a depth of wisdom and contentment that can enrich their lives in ways that younger people may not yet fully appreciate. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and uncertainties that can hinder their enjoyment of life. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming, leaving little time for leisure and self-discovery. In contrast, older individuals have often achieved a degree of stability and financial security, allowing them to focus on personal interests and passions. They may have more time to travel, pursue hobbies, or simply relax and enjoy the fruits of their labor. 

Secondly, older people have the benefit of accumulated life experience. They have witnessed a wider range of events, encountered diverse perspectives, and learned from their mistakes. This wealth of experience can foster a sense of perspective and resilience that allows them to navigate life's challenges with greater ease and appreciation. Young people, on the other hand, are still learning and growing, and their experiences may be more limited. 

Finally, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. While young people may find excitement in adrenaline-fueled activities or social gatherings, older individuals may derive greater satisfaction from quiet moments of reflection, meaningful relationships, or acts of service. Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is not solely determined by age but by individual values, priorities, and perspectives. 

In conclusion, while youth may offer certain advantages, it is inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. The enjoyment of life is a complex and multifaceted experience that evolves throughout the lifespan. Older individuals possess a wealth of wisdom, stability, and perspective that can contribute to a fulfilling and enjoyable life.

"Portrayed by enormus poets and artiests, life and the joys of life are so attracting as well as noble to everyone. Lives of young people are appriciated as being vigorous and vivid, while older people are admired for having wiser speculation and richer experiences in life. But who, after all, enjoy life better? In my point of view, young people tend to enjoy life more.

     First and foremost, curiosity is a rather important factor in the enjoyment of life. Young people, just like other young animals, possess enough curiosity to urge them exploring this world with discovering eyes and open hearts, which in turn rewards young people of an endless advanture of new archievements.

     Another reason, perhaps equally crucial, is the fact that young people always have more physical capability than older people do. Far too often can we see young people mastering all kinds of exciting sports and engage themselves with thrills. By contrast, what we can frequently hear from the older people is simply the complaints like, ""If only I was 20 years younger."" or ""God bless my heart."".

     Of course, older people do have their own advantage in enjoying life. The aboundant experience accumulated along with life span enable them to taste life in a slower, yet maybe wiser pace. But also undeniable is the pitiful truth that they often don't have adequate energy and passion to keep up with the fast tempo of time. They will more probably take a rest from time to time and doze over where young people enjoy their precious youth with no reversion.

    ""Old people have a glorious past after them, while young people have a brilliant future before them."" This quote has addressed the problem in a neat and sentimental way. With far more planty time and novel futures ahead, young people will almost definitely enjoy life better.",
"We can always hearing people saying that life of some old people are become more and colorful, even more that some of their grandchildren. This is true. However, bacically, it is no doubt that the old people can enjoy less fun than the young, we can just deduce it by looking the old people around us.

First of all, as geting older, it is inevitable for the older to have more problem on thier health. So they can not doing what they what equally as the young, they can hardly play football dancing the hip-hop, or even just ride a bike around the park. Moreover  with the decay of vitality, the older people don't even to do such kind of thing, which in my opinion is obviously the happiness that life has offer.

Second, the young are not only physically stronger than the older, but they are more open-minded and have curiosity to try something new. The joy and satisfaction that one can get should never be underestimated. 

Thirdly, as for the older people, one alligation often made is that they do have much more sparetime, to do whatever they like. They can spend the whole day sitting beside the river bank waiting for some ignorant poor fish to eat their bite, or take care of their plants and vegetable in the garden. But I my mind, this is only one kind of enjoyment, which can not compare with those what the young have when they achieve great accomplishments. Althoght it would be hard for a scientist to discover a new theory, or for a business man to make their company larger and more well-known, yet the satifaciton thereafter are an not be underestimated.

Althought it is hard for some older to accepte that fact that they can enjoy less enjoyment , yet they have to facing to reality.",
"In my opinion, I agree with this statement because if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you are expected to work in many sectors if we take the view from a working aspect. You are also able to turn into another sector for any reason with out the need of a long and costly formation about your new work. From another aspect, I think that a person with a global knowledge is more interesting than a person how only has knowledge about a specific subject. In fact, with a person who has a global knowledge you can talk about everything and you are sure to learn something and that is person will have a point of view about everything. In the other hand, the other person would be more boring and not so interesting becquse she only knows a specific subject so after at while talking about this subject, you will feel a bite boring.
But having knoweldge about a very specific subject can also be very positive. Indeed, in the business sector, we can see that industries that are specialized in only one sector are usually more efficiant than others campany which try to extend theirselves to several market with products that are complitly differents between them. Indeed, the specialized companies  know very well  their product and also every thing that it is around the productt : production, custumers, market, competition... so they are very good in what they do whereas a company who extend too much will be in the end good in nothing.
As a conclusion I think that you must always find a balance between beeing general and specific in every t",
"I agree and in the same time I disagree with this statement. It defers frome each side point of view.

    Let  us supposed I'm a young guy I will agree. Because young people can play alot of sports like football, basketball, swimming, gouging, and body bilding, but eldary people cann't. Also thay can do dangirus sports like bongy jumbing. And can travel for along time with out taking medisin like eldary ones. However young people can  gather with friend at late time enjoying them selfs and can sleep late unlike eldary people.

   And if we look at it from old people view thay will say we can arrange our time and play sports like table tennes, cheese, monopoly and we can enjoy our time by watching T.V. vissiting friends. They don't need phisical motion to enjoy life.

   Finaly am with youn",
"I think young people do not have to take more time for the community. So I disagree with this. There are 2 reasons why I disagree.  The first one is the increase number of the old people.And the second one is working hard for the community without no money is not a good idea. 
 First, there are too many old people in this world. That means there is not enough young people to help in the community , especially in Japan. Almost 25 percent of the population in Japan is the old people. So adults say the young people must help the community more often, but that will be too many job for the young people. There will not be enough young people to do the job. So I do not think making the young people work more for the community is not the best idea.
 Second, working for the community without no money is not good for the young people. There are many young people who do not have a job and having a hard time to live without their money. So working without the payment from the country or from some company, it will not be a good time for the young people. Because many young people want some job for their life. So if old people need some help from the young people for the community, they should give them some payment.
 Thus, because of the increase of the old people and no money  to the young people  for the work in the community, I think young people do not have to help for the community more often.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While some may prioritize personal pursuits, a significant number of young individuals dedicate their time and energy to making a positive impact on their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various initiatives. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community service projects on a larger scale. Through online platforms, they can easily connect with like-minded individuals, mobilize volunteers, and raise awareness for various causes. For instance, the recent surge in online campaigns for environmental conservation and social justice movements has seen young people actively leading the charge, utilizing social media to organize protests, fundraisers, and awareness campaigns. 

Secondly, many young people are actively involved in traditional community service organizations. From volunteering at local soup kitchens and homeless shelters to participating in youth groups and mentorship programs, they dedicate their time and skills to supporting those in need. These experiences foster a sense of empathy and responsibility, instilling in them a desire to contribute to the well-being of their communities. 

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that young people are often at the forefront of innovation and social change. Their entrepreneurial spirit and technological proficiency have led to the development of innovative solutions to address societal challenges. From creating mobile applications that connect volunteers with local organizations to developing sustainable business models that benefit their communities, young people are actively shaping the future of community service. 

In conclusion, while it is easy to make generalizations about young people, it is crucial to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From online activism to traditional volunteer work and innovative solutions, young people are actively engaged in making a difference. Their commitment to service demonstrates their desire to create a better future for themselves and their communities.",
"The more you know, the more valuable you are to your community. I agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. The world we live in demands us to be better prepared, open-minded, and adapted to our surroundings; technology allows us to reach specific important information when needed. 

Taking as a reference the business world, every year we see how globalization grows in the countries and how barriers disappear, creating the necessity of better prepared persons that understand the interactions between several fields of study, as well as the problems that are derived from these interactions. These persons can identify and analyze problems or issues that arise and that need complex solutions. Eventough they are not experts in one specific subject, they can diagnose a situation and offer different solutions according to what they know from many subjects. In contrast, an individual specialized in only one subject might not be able to give value to the chain, and might just be looking for a mathematical solution, in the case he/she was a mathematitian. 

Improvements in technology allow people to research and learn the important points of an specific field in the case more detail or comprehension is needed for an specific situation. Good quality information is available to everyone in just a few click in the internet.

In an organization, a balance between the persons that have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and persons experts in one field has to be considered. Although experts in a field might not be capable to make a complex analysis and may lack a global vision of the situation, they might be useful to help solve an issue in the event that the solution is of his/her domain.

Having a broad knowledge of many topics enables you to give more value to your community or your business, by having a more open view of the daily situations that arise and by knowing where to find a solution or who is the right person who could fix a problem.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image, often exaggerating or even fabricating qualities to entice consumers. This essay argues that most advertisements do indeed make products seem much better than they really are, employing a range of techniques to achieve this goal. 

One of the most common tactics used by advertisers is the selective presentation of information. They often highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new weight-loss supplement might showcase individuals achieving dramatic transformations, but fail to mention the possible side effects or the need for a balanced diet and exercise. This selective approach creates a distorted perception of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently employ visual and auditory elements to evoke emotional responses in viewers.
A car commercial might feature a sleek, luxurious vehicle speeding along a scenic highway, accompanied by upbeat music and a voiceover emphasizing freedom and adventure. This combination of imagery and sound creates a sense of excitement and desirability, even if the car's actual performance or practicality is less impressive. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may strive for honesty and transparency, the majority employ techniques that make products appear more appealing than they truly are. By selectively presenting information, using emotional appeals, and creating unrealistic expectations, advertisers aim to capture the attention and desire of consumers. It is crucial for individuals to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate the information presented in advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I do not completely  agree with the above statement  because advertisements have both advantages and disadvantages.

Firstly, i will discuss about the advantages with quite a few examples. What exactly a person looks for while buying a product? may be the price, quality or some other factor. More clearly, we can say that he or she is not sure in certain situations. Finally, they make a decision to buy something new which they have seen last night in the commercial ad. Simlarly, when people does not know anything about a particular product, in most cases, they rely on advertisements. Thats an other plus point of advertising. Apart from this, most of the time people spend their leisure time by watching television and reading books, which are the excellent sources for advertising. As a result, public come to know about the new products through the ads.

Coming to the disadvantages, the first and foremost is with the children. Whenever they found the ad to be attractive, they want u to buy the product for them, regardless they use it or not. When comes to the food stuff, they always try to go for the junk food, where the ads cash in by showing them attractive. Sometimes, we see some of the products to be less expensive. We usually gets attracted to and purchase them. But the final result is that it gets damaged after a short period. We have to compromise for the quality. 

In the conclusion, i would like to say that advertisements does not make us buy less quality products all the time but they do sometimes. It is our mental ability to think what to purchase and what not? In most cases, the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of products, I firmly believe that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks, making products seem much better than they really are. This tendency stems from the inherent nature of advertising, which aims to persuade and entice consumers. 

One compelling example of this exaggeration is the portrayal of beauty products in advertisements. Often, models with flawless skin and hair are used to promote creams and shampoos, creating an unrealistic standard of beauty. The advertisements may claim that these products can achieve miraculous transformations, but in reality, the results are often far less dramatic. Similarly, food advertisements frequently use techniques like close-ups and slow-motion shots to make dishes appear more appetizing than they actually are. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas depicted in these advertisements can create a false sense of satisfaction and lead consumers to expect a culinary experience that may not be entirely accurate. 

Furthermore, advertisements often focus on highlighting the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, advertisements for cars may emphasize their sleek design, powerful engine, and luxurious features, but they may fail to mention the high fuel consumption, maintenance costs, or safety concerns. This selective presentation of information can mislead consumers into believing that the product is perfect, when in reality, it may have significant downsides. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can provide valuable information about products, it is essential to recognize that they are often designed to create a favorable impression and may not accurately reflect the true nature of the product. By understanding the persuasive tactics employed in advertising, consumers can make more informed decisions and avoid falling prey to exaggerated claims.",
"In the society, the people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are more adapt than the people specialize in one specific subject, and many companies need the people have the konwledge of many academic subjects caused by many people only specialize in one specific subject can not finish the jobs and tasks very well.It will make the companies or many people think the people have the knowledge of many academic subjects are better.
In my life, I have an uncle, he has much konwledge of many academic subjects.He is very successful in his company, and he has been recongnized by many people.He can do many job vey well, and he has mani kinds of knowledge, it makes he can talk with many things to other people.These things will make other people think my uncle is a very interesting man, and he can do many things the others can not do.Once,my uncle received a task contented many kinds of academic knowledge,in his company,no one could finished this task except him.After that, the chairman of his company trusted him very much, and promote him from a worker to a manager.The konwledge of many academic subject is the most impotant factor of the success of him.
On the other hand, according to a survey ,the man who has the knowledge of many academic subjects will have double chances to find the goog job compare the man who just specialized in one specific subject.Because the man who has the more knowledge can do more things than the man who just know less knowledge.So in the society, people always think the man who has the konwledge of many academic subjects is  better than the man specialized in one specific subject.This thinking has formed from past, and it can not change in the minds of people.

"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. However, the statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" is a generalization that requires careful consideration. While it is true that some advertisements employ exaggerated claims and misleading imagery to create an idealized version of a product, it is not accurate to say that this is the case for all advertisements. 

Firstly, many advertisements focus on highlighting the genuine benefits and features of a product. For example, advertisements for technological devices often showcase their functionality, performance, and user-friendliness. These advertisements aim to provide consumers with accurate information to make informed choices. 

Secondly, regulations and consumer protection laws exist to prevent misleading advertising practices. Advertising agencies and companies are held accountable for making truthful and substantiated claims. While some advertisements may push the boundaries of ethical advertising, the majority strive to adhere to these regulations. 

Finally, consumers are becoming increasingly discerning and aware of advertising tactics. With access to online reviews, product comparisons, and independent consumer reports, consumers are better equipped to evaluate the validity of advertising claims. This increased awareness has led to a shift towards more transparent and informative advertising practices. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may exaggerate the qualities of products, it is inaccurate to claim that most advertisements do so. Many advertisements aim to provide accurate information and highlight genuine benefits, while regulations and consumer awareness contribute to a more responsible advertising landscape. Therefore, it is important to approach advertisements with a critical eye and rely on multiple sources of information before making purchasing decisions.",
"I potentially disagree with the statement that "" young people enjoy life more than older people do"". First, what i feel is that it's not the age which determines the level of pleasure or enjoyment in life.  It's basically our attitude toward life which enables us to take the maximum out of what life has to offer. Our outlook towards life is the determining factor for the parameters that we set for enjoying life. 
	Secondly, its a matter of committment and perception that wins us points in the game of life. For example, an old person having an optimistic approach toward everthing what life has to offer would rather enjoy stressless leisurely evenings sitting in the garden or maybe gardening. In contrast to this a young man having more than half of his life to live could be sitting on a chair in the same very garden and cursing his fate for providing hinderances in his path to success.
	Thirdly,  it may be assumed that the younger part of life or the youth age demands more of you but it doesn't mean that a young man simply cannot enjoy his life because he is has more work / assingments to complete. It's a function of mind games that determines individual perception and it is this perception that fuels us to look towards life in a different plain altogether. I have seen old people like my grandmother enjoy trekking and mountaineering. History, like all other examples incorporates one in these terms too. We've had scientist who were old enough to be counted out as non-exciting in general view but but active enough to invent some of the most exciting things on earth.
	Lastly, the fact that the body may be old enough but it is our mind and will power that combine together to give us a rush of adrenaline even at the age of 70.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject is a complex one. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that a broad knowledge base is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.


Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters intellectual curiosity and adaptability. By exploring various academic subjects, individuals develop a wider understanding of the world and its interconnectedness. This allows them to see problems from multiple perspectives, think critically, and find innovative solutions. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics might be better equipped to understand the causes of historical events, while a scientist with a background in literature might be more adept at communicating complex scientific concepts to the public. 

Secondly, a broad education promotes well-rounded individuals who can contribute to society in diverse ways. In today's rapidly changing world, individuals need to be able to adapt to new situations and learn new skills. A broad knowledge base provides the foundation for this adaptability, allowing individuals to move seamlessly between different fields and contribute to a variety of projects. For example, a person with a background in both engineering and art might be able to design innovative and aesthetically pleasing products. 

Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters empathy and understanding. By learning about different cultures, perspectives, and disciplines, individuals develop a greater appreciation for the diversity of human experience. This can lead to more effective communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, ultimately contributing to a more harmonious and inclusive society. 

In conclusion, while specialization can be valuable, it is ultimately more beneficial to have a broad knowledge base. A broad education fosters intellectual curiosity, adaptability, and empathy, making individuals more well-rounded, adaptable, and capable of contributing to a diverse and interconnected world. ",
"I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are. 
	We can see many products advertisements like this statements. For example when I watched TV commercial of sandwitch or humbergare, the commercial really make me hungry and I want to eat that products becouse it looks very dericious and many vegitables and meets. But if I go to the store I'll see very different sandwitch or humbergare, those products looks more poor than TV commercials. I have disappointed it many times.
	In concludion, there are many advertisements. Some people said that advertisement is very important role for selling. They update advertisement many times for few terms. If you want to sell some products a lot and want people to have interest you will make advertisements look good. I can understand this system for selling; advertisements make products should seem more better than they really are.  But I think that they should sell more simillar products to advertisements.",
"Advertising a product is an effective way for companies to increase their revenue by displaying their products or services in various ways (TV commercials, posters, shows, etc...). It can be argued that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
	Advertisements will never show the disadvantages or problems with a product that is being displayed. The company of the specific product will only show the positive side of the picture, whereby they will exaggerate upon the advantages of the product. This is only natural, as they are trying to sell their product and in order to accomplish this, they need to catch the eye of the consumer. For example, advertisements or commercials of SUVs are always over-the-top. They will show their SUVs going on the worst possible terrains, showing how effective they are and they will always point out small details that make it ""the best in the world"" or ""better than their rivals"". They also point out that their SUV is the one for everyone. That may not be neccessarily true, as everybody has their own tastes and not everybody is forced to like the same thing. 
	The specific advertisement i talked about will never show how reliable the SUV is or what problems one can encounter compared with it's rivals. Whenever a price is given of the product (for example an SUV), that price is usually the basic model or the minimum that won't get the consumer much. In other words,  they are cheating in a way because a consumer who becomes interested in the SUV will find out that for all the facilities the SUV has in the advertisement, there will be a big increase in the money paid from the price given in the advertisement.     
	The companies know how weak the consumer can be once a successful advertisement of a product is given and will therefore make the product look like it's the ultimate thing to have. Their only aim is to make the consumer buy the product. They do not neccessarily care about what happens after the purchase, as the company has already benefited from the profit being made. 
	All of the above supports my opinion on agreeing with the statement that most advertisements do make products seem much better than they actually are, as they do not give the consumer a clear idea of what the product is really like.",
"In the realm of education, the age-old debate between breadth and depth of knowledge continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization in a specific subject offers profound expertise, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This perspective stems from the inherent value of interdisciplinary thinking, the adaptability it fosters, and the enriched understanding of the world it provides.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to engage in interdisciplinary thinking, which is crucial in today's interconnected world. By understanding concepts from various fields, one can draw connections and synthesize information in novel ways. For instance, a historian with knowledge of economics can better analyze the impact of trade on historical events. Similarly, a scientist with a background in philosophy can critically evaluate the ethical implications of their research. This ability to connect seemingly disparate disciplines leads to more comprehensive and insightful solutions to complex problems.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters adaptability and resilience in a rapidly changing world. Individuals with diverse knowledge are better equipped to navigate new challenges and embrace emerging opportunities. For example, a graduate with a broad background in humanities and technology might be more adaptable to the evolving job market than someone with a highly specialized degree. This adaptability is essential for success in a world where skills and knowledge are constantly evolving.
Finally, a broad knowledge base enriches our understanding of the world and our place within it. By exploring different subjects, we gain a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of human knowledge and the complexities of the human experience. From literature to science, from history to art, each discipline offers unique perspectives and insights that contribute to a more holistic understanding of the world. This enriched perspective allows us to engage with the world in a more informed and meaningful way.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers invaluable benefits. It fosters interdisciplinary thinking, promotes adaptability, and enriches our understanding of the world. By embracing a diverse range of knowledge, we equip ourselves with the tools necessary to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain carefree energy and a sense of boundless possibility, it is a mistake to assume that this equates to greater enjoyment.
Life, in its entirety, is a complex tapestry woven with threads of both joy and sorrow, and the experience of these emotions evolves throughout our lifespan.
One key difference lies in the nature of experiences. Young people often prioritize novelty and excitement, seeking thrills and adventures. This can lead to a perception of greater enjoyment, but it is often superficial and fleeting. Older individuals, on the other hand, have a deeper understanding of the nuances of life. They have experienced both triumphs and setbacks, and their appreciation for the simple joys of life, such as meaningful relationships and personal accomplishments, may be more profound.
Furthermore, the concept of enjoyment is subjective. What brings joy to a young person may not resonate with an older individual. For example, a teenager might find immense satisfaction in attending a concert with friends, while an elderly person might derive greater pleasure from spending a quiet afternoon with their grandchildren. 

In conclusion, while youth may be a time of carefree exploration, it is not necessarily a period of greater enjoyment. Life is a journey, and the experience of joy evolves with each stage. Both young and old have their own unique perspectives and sources of happiness, and it is impossible to definitively claim that one group enjoys life more than the other.",
"I really agree with this topic.  When I see the advertisement, I become to want it or eat it or drink it.  I have a experience about it.  When I was watching TV, I saw the commercial about ""Taco-Bell"".  I had never eatten it.  It seemed really good.  Then after school, I asked my host mother to take me there because I seriously wanted to eat it.  Then we went there.  And I ordered it.  I was very surprised when it came.  It was just like my finger sized.  When I watched the commercial it was much bigger than real.  And it was warm, not hot.  I always become to want it when I see the advertisement.  So I was glad it was not like machine.  Because it was not so much expensive.  Sometimes I really want to get something expensive when I see the advertisement.  But I can stop feeling that I want it.  I think because I missed the "" Taco-Bell""'s meal.  
  As we can see there are many advertisements in the world.  I don't think it is good to make priducts seem much better than they really are.  It is kind of trickster.  It is kind of illegal things!!  
  However if I became someone who was selling something, I would have the advertisement.  And I would say something which make products seem much better than they really are.  So everyone dose it.  I think it is like lace, and someone who male gppd advertisement would win that lace.  
  We have to search what it really is form hidding in advertisements.  It is hard because every advertisements hides the truth.  We have to think about it deeply before we get it.  But I always become to want it.  I would like to change it.",
"Knowledege is something which we gain everyday.  Thus It  should include learning of various subjects equally but not speacializing in one of them only. According to me speacializing in a single subject is not always useful  because of various reasons.
     Firstly, it is not helpful in certain difficult situations where knowledge about the specific thing is required. For example incase of short circuit it is important for the person to know what steps to take.For this the knowledge of physics is required, It is similar in the case of bleeding or any other physical injury,the basic knowledge in first aid ,learnt in human sciences is required.Hence in practical sense knowledge of various subjects is of great importance.
     Secondly, it is more demanding in these mordern days. People are not really sure of being successful in a particular feild hence it is always safe to have equal knowledge about evrything as it will enable us to take up any proffession in futre. As according to famous economist Gunnar Myrdal"" Education should be such that it should generate employment in any feild taken up by the educated.""
Thus broad knowledge ensures employment oppurtunities at a better rate as compared to knowledge gained in a specific feild.
                 Thirdly, knowledge about a variety of subjects would not bore the person but it will make it interesting for him as he will concentrate on different subjects rather than a single one.
                   Fourthly, even quiz competitions lay emphasis on equal learning of all the subjects. The questions asked in such competitions are related to different subjects. Hence even in knowledge testing and gaining competitions like the quiz competitions show that broad knowledge is better as compare to speacialized knowledge in a specific subject.",
"Coca Cola's new product, CocaCola Zero, announced some months ago with huge advertisements, provoqued a great echo all over the world. A sweet nutrition without sugar, that was the strategy to sell a popular product in even greater amounts.
But in my opinion, the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is true in many cases. Advertisements argue that the quality of the product they want to sell is better than that of all other producers, but it is available at the same or even a lower price. The consequences I draw out of this strategy are firstly, the production costs were reduced or, secondly, the quality of the product is not as good as the advertisement wants to tell us.
Regarding sugar free products, for example, it is clear that an artificial substance has to replace the sugar by keeping the taste. Then the product may be sugar free, but added with many artificial ingredients which are not mentioned or written on a place hard to be seen by the customers.
As a second example, I will mention shortly the consequences of advertisements denying the real quality of the product by regarding cosmetic products. Especially young people who have problems with their skins are attracted by advertisements which promise to help them with a product wich costs less than others but has better impacts on the skin. In the meantime, the ingredients of this product do not help or have even negative effects the customers do not get to know by reading the instructions. So young people trie one product after another just following the false promises of some advertisements.
In the end, advertisements always play with their direct or indirect influence on the customer. And unless the customer does not reflect this influence critically, the producers will not change their habitude in making the products seem much better than they are.",
"In my oppinion, it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Personally, I like to know all about a specific subject because in most of the cases it is the only way to understand the real truth. This real truth would not be achieved if one do not get to the core of the subject in hand.
Futhermore, I think that not only specialization is desirable and necesary for science to advance but also broad knowledge is the reason why during several centuries there has been so few cientific discoveries. An example could be that as scientists specialized in certain areas and subjects, they started to make astonishing discoveries that revolutionized humankind.
Also, because I am an economist, I feel urged to know everything about a certain subject in order to be able to find the correct solution for the problem I am working on. For example, I would not be able to explain the reason for the high inflation rates that occured during the last decade in Argentina unless I get deep knowledge about the causes of inflation. In that example it is clear that a broad knowledge about Argentina, or even argentinean economy, would not be enough.
On the other hand, it should be said that certain disciplines such as philosophy need people who have broad knowledge about many subjects in order to be able to move forward and have a profund impact in society.\
In summary, I think that specialization is the key to knowledge for most sciences beacuse it allows the scientist to gain a good insight about all it matters about his area of study.",
"The assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibilities, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders is a simplistic and inaccurate view. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. What brings joy to a young person, like exploring new experiences or pursuing romantic relationships, may hold little appeal to an older individual who values stability and contentment.
For example, a young person might find immense satisfaction in traveling the world, while an older person might prefer the comfort of their home and the company of loved ones.

Secondly, the enjoyment of life is often influenced by life circumstances. Young people may face financial constraints, academic pressures, and social anxieties that can significantly impact their overall well-being. Conversely, older individuals may have achieved financial security, established careers, and built strong relationships, contributing to a sense of fulfillment and contentment. 

Finally, the enjoyment of life is a continuous journey, not a static state. As individuals age, they gain wisdom, perspective, and a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. This can lead to a more profound appreciation for life's simple pleasures and a greater sense of peace and acceptance.

In conclusion, while youth may possess a certain energy and freedom, it is inaccurate to claim that they inherently enjoy life more than older people. The enjoyment of life is a multifaceted experience that is influenced by individual preferences, life circumstances, and personal growth. Both young and old can find joy and fulfillment in their own unique ways, and it is essential to recognize the diverse perspectives and experiences that shape our understanding of happiness.",
"Yes, young people enjoy life more than older people. This can be supported by various factors that are usually common in day-today life.The first factor that is also an important factor would be health.  Many people who are olde may face many health related problems that average adult may not face. So, because adults are more stronger than older people health wise, they are more likely to enjoy the life. Youger people can participate in various activities that older people may not do. For example, adults can enjoy travelling to various places and like to do various activities like: skeing, trekking a moutain, surfing in ocean etc, which older people cannot probably do. Adults are likely to party more than older people, because they do not have the health restrictions. But, there might be exceptions that people enjoy partying in there later years. Older people can also enjoy there life teaching younger people their experiances from their before years. But, younger people enjoy daily situations more than older people. For example, younger people can enjoy the university life by means of learning, participating in sports or in extra -curricular activities. These things are not done by older people though they did these things before, they are not enjoyin those things in their older age. Yougsters can experiment with various things, may that be in academic contest or in general life. Young people can also go to various holiday destinations like going to hill tops, which might be prohibited to elder people due to health concerns. In this way young people enjoy life more than older people.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has empowered young people to organize and participate in community initiatives on a larger scale. Through online petitions, crowdfunding campaigns, and social media awareness drives, they can mobilize support for causes they care about, reaching a wider audience and amplifying their impact. For instance, the recent global climate strikes, organized primarily by young people, demonstrated their ability to mobilize millions worldwide, demanding action on climate change. 

Furthermore, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer work, often focusing on areas that resonate with their interests and skills. From mentoring underprivileged children to organizing environmental clean-up drives, they are actively addressing social issues and contributing to the well-being of their communities. Many schools and universities also encourage community service, offering opportunities for students to gain valuable experience while making a difference. 

In conclusion, while it may be tempting to paint a picture of young people as apathetic towards community service, the reality is far more nuanced. Young people are actively engaged in contributing to their communities, often in innovative and impactful ways. From online activism to traditional volunteer work, they are demonstrating their commitment to making a positive difference in the world.",
"There are so many subjects which entices our concerning during study in university. It is not a matter you're bachelor or master or doctor. The real essentical of academic subject, knowledge itself, is interesting and attracting for human. But, I don't agree with the assetion that we must boraden our knowledge better than specialize in on specific subjec. I will give you a two reasons. 

 First, there is no such easy academic subject which can conquer in one or two decade. Almost every academic subject needs one's whole life's efforts. Most important thing to become a intellecture is concenturation in one specific subject not become a know-everything man. Actually, human can not kwow whole things of the world. For example, there is a person who I know. He studies philosophy and he also eager to know lot of things about the non-philosophical things. It is not a bad attutude I think. But, He didn't get the degree in year what he plans to get that because of that eager distracted his concenturation. 
 
 Second, the society wants the person who has knowledge which is specialized in one specific subject.  If he knows lot of other knowledge,  of course it is a good things. But it is not a primary but secondary. People who are talent in one specific subject can works as proffessional. But the person who know many things but not specialized is not a proffessional. For example, there was two friends of mine. the one of them was talented in many things. he was a good singer and good dancer. He also studed well but not the best. When he became a adult, he get a job. But it was not a specialized job. The another friends was talented in only school study. But when he became adult, he got a job in a specialized area and he got a lot of salery. 

 To sum up, very essential respect of academic knowledge doesn't allow multi-studying. Because the ability of human is so limited, We must concentrate in one study. And The society need proffesional person not a know-everthing man.",
"I support the argument that young people do not give enough time helping their communities. In today's context and scenario the concept of benevolence and brotherhood no longer exist. 
The youngsters these days have become so obsessed with the materialistic pleasures that they tend to overlook  or appreciate the environment they have been brought up in. They are part of a rat race and constantly competing with their contemporaries so as to get ahead of them. They seem least bothered when it comes to actually doing something for the benefit of someone else. It is the ""I, Me, Myself"" scenario that prevails today.
I can say from personal experience that the essence of belonging to a community is lost let alone helping others! In the stranglehold of societal demands, we are all subjected to just working for ourselves, to achieve as much as possible - more perhaps, if achievable! Its all about goals, targets and results. We seem to have forgotten that at the end of the day, we, the human race must live in cooperation and share a symbiotic relationship with every other being. We must learn to 'give' and not just 'take' - For the sake of morality if nothing else! But morals and principles are a thing of the past, long gone and forgotten. 
We  tend to forget that only when we  give something do we get something in return. But again, just for our own selfish reasons we must not resort to helping anybody else. The realisation must come from within, it must be like an awakening that would lead us to helping others, sharing with others and creating an amible and comfortable environment. As citizens of a community, it is our responsibility to give other members their due. 
It is indeed the need of the day to reinstute the values of helping others for the upliftment of society and the entire human community.",
"I think to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is good for people than to specialize in one specific subjuct. If someone only study about mathematics, he or she can't make a life more variously and miss many useful information for survive. I would present two specific reasons to support my idea.
 First, a person who study only one subject can't sustain their lifes well. People are social beings so they have to learn about many things to survive. For example, If a professor of the history learn about history he or she could be poor because lackness of economic knowledge. My major is history, so I always see my professors who studying their own intrest. However, they are not good at financial techquinics, so they  to miss much money that they could earn. If they could earn much more money than now, they can concentrate on their subjects as they don't  worry about thier financial problems.
 Secondly, one subject is related with other subjects densely. If you want to study history you have to learn other languages, literatures, philosophis and so on. When I read a book about Roman history, I also need to study about their literatures and philosophies. In addition, I have to learn about other languages if I want to read materials from other countries. It only allow me to understand specific factors accurately. 
 To conclude, I think to study board knowledge of many academics becaus of its useful facor to survive and helpful factor to study your own interest subject.",
"In the nowdays sociaty ,our basic ability which is also the weapon for us to compete for our future career is ""Knowledge"" , so people always judge one person by his knowledge,so there comes the question that should we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject, I think it attribute to the what catagory of your work 
     If we take the work more sociaty,such as if you are a actors or you work for mass communacation or medias such as TV station or radio stations ,you must make sure that you have achieved lots of abilities and learn more about new things evertyday,so you must take broad knowledge of many academic subjects such like geography, anstronomy ,anthropology and the most important is your basic subjects. since you have lots of different knowleges that you can be more brilliant for your work .Ands also your work need you to communacate with lots of sociaty peoples so you must make yourself know what others do not know ,so you must learn more different kinds of subjects ,meanwhile you will also be intersting person!
     If we want to be a scholar ,we must take in one specific subject in order to let a yourself to be good at one special skill.therefore you can have all your spirit to analyze in one subject and learn that very well .through this way of study you can be a expert in one field such like you can be a Psycologist if you just take the course o",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a constant debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having broad knowledge across various academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters a well-rounded individual, capable of critical thinking, problem-solving, and adapting to a rapidly changing world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base equips individuals with a wider perspective and the ability to connect ideas from different disciplines. For instance, a historian studying the rise of empires might gain valuable insights from an economist's analysis of trade patterns or a sociologist's understanding of social structures. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues and encourages innovative solutions.
Furthermore, a broad education fosters critical thinking and analytical skills. By engaging with diverse subjects, individuals develop the ability to evaluate information from multiple angles, identify biases, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking is essential in navigating the information overload of the modern world and making sound judgments in personal and professional life.
Finally, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability and resilience. In today's rapidly evolving job market, individuals need to be flexible and capable of learning new skills quickly. A broad education provides a solid foundation upon which individuals can build their expertise and readily adapt to new challenges. For example, a graduate with a broad background in the humanities might transition into a career in data analysis by acquiring the necessary technical skills, while someone with a specialized degree in engineering might find themselves applying their problem-solving abilities to a completely different field.
In conclusion, while specialization can lead to significant expertise, a broad knowledge base offers a more holistic and adaptable approach to learning. It fosters critical thinking, interdisciplinary understanding, and the ability to navigate a complex world. Therefore, I believe that it is ultimately more beneficial to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",
"Industrial engineering is a profession having a broad area becomes more popular in our country recently. It is thought that studying everything a little is better than specializing in one area. However in my opinion it is not a good idea.

Firstly, people with a broad range of interests can not learn and use everything well. It is obvious that human beings have a capacity and this can be only enough for some extend. Specializing on a specific subject makes it possible to use all your efford for it. Hence you will be more powerfull on that area.

Secondly, studying everything may be usefull for someone to see the big picture and sawing some problems easier. however fixing the problems usually needs to be an expert. For example knowing accounting and computer programming may help you to define a problem in the accounting software, but only an software expert can fix it.

Lastly, think about the inventions that are really essantial for our life. For example electricity, engines, computers, and so on. All of these are a product of a long training on a certain subject. This process is an increasingly learning process and it does not have an end. Hence, people should use all their efford to achieve the point that they can achieve.

In conclusion, it may be said that having broad knowledge is better to find the problems or something else. However this is not an effective idea for being an expert and fixing the problems or improving the quality of life. Thus, specializing on a certain aspect is better.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

One compelling example is the rise of youth-led initiatives addressing social issues. From organizing environmental cleanups to advocating for social justice, young people are utilizing their creativity and passion to make a tangible difference. The recent surge in climate activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, showcases their commitment to tackling pressing global challenges.

Furthermore, many young people dedicate their time to volunteering in various organizations. From assisting at local soup kitchens to mentoring underprivileged children, they contribute their skills and compassion to improve the lives of others. These acts of service not only benefit the community but also foster personal growth and a sense of purpose in young individuals.
While it's easy to focus on the perceived apathy of some, it's crucial to recognize the vast number of young people who are actively engaged in their communities. Their dedication and commitment to making a positive impact should be acknowledged and celebrated.

Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Exposure to diverse subjects allows individuals to connect ideas from different disciplines, leading to innovative solutions.

This interdisciplinary approach is crucial in addressing complex challenges that transcend traditional academic boundaries. 

Secondly, a broad knowledge base enhances adaptability and resilience in a constantly changing world. In an era of rapid technological advancements and shifting job markets, individuals with specialized skills may find themselves ill-equipped to navigate new challenges. Conversely, those with a broad understanding of various fields can readily adapt to new situations and embrace opportunities that arise. For example, a person with a background in both literature and computer science might be well-suited to pursue a career in digital storytelling or interactive media.

"Although it is good to specialize in one subject, I agree with the opinion that people have to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.
  First, even if you are interested in that one subject you study, you had better to see other subjects. Seeing other ranges will be helpful to enlarge your knowledge. If you see many things and read many kinds of books, your brain and feelings will be soft and you can learn more things than before.
  Secondly, it will also help you to make it sure what you have learned. In one way, you can not know what is correct or not because your sight is narrow and small. If you learned something about the one specific subject, you can not say that in other subject the same. You have to see it from many ways or you can not judge it. 
  And also, all academic subjects connect to each subject. We exist in this world and many materials exist together in a complex way as well. Although each subject might look different at all, in fact, they are telling us about this world. Unexpectedly, all subjects are same things.
  In sum, I support the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects with those three reasons after all.",
"Knowledge is a very important part of our daily routine.Gaining knowledge may be a very imprtant part of a students career.Students gaining knowlede are offered jobs in view of their knowledge towards a particular subject.It may be a point that it is essential to have a minimum grip over the remaining subjects rather than just having broad knowledge about a single acadamic subject.
So by the following we can say that it is better to have a broad knowledge about many acadamic subjects rather that just a single or specific subject.
                               There may arise different situations by which the broad knowledge ove a specific acadamic subject would be sufficient.Just consider a software engineer who has a broad knowledge about the software part of his system is not capable of solving the hjardware issues arising.In the same way a person who is good at computers cannot work for a company where mechanical engineers are required.Hence if a person is capable of having broader knowledge about the various acadamic subjects there may be chance that he mey even jump from one sector to the other just like a person findin softaware jobs more interesting thjan the mechanical jobs.He can change his platform only if he has a broader knowledge about the software concepts.
                                    Having broad knowledge over various acadamic subjects would help us out in various situations.Let us even consider a person attending an interview in a huge establishment.Ther is no gaurantee that the inteview may contain questions relating to his subject , rather the interview may even consisit of questions over various issues relating to various other subjects.A person who is capable of containing broader knbowledge over just one issue may not be able to get through the interview to get the job.
                                 We can even consider the part of quiz competetion that include the subject of various other subjects rather than just a single subject.A person with broader knowledge over various subjects may only be capable of clearing the quiz competetion.
                     Hence we can say that ""IT IS BETTER TO HAVE BROAD KNOWLEDGE OVER MANY ACADAMIC SUBJECTS RATHER THAN JUST SPECIALIZE IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT"".",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth may possess a certain carefree spirit and a sense of boundless possibilities, it is a mistake to assume that happiness is solely a product of age. Both young and old individuals can experience profound joy and fulfillment, albeit in different ways. 

Firstly, young people often face a unique set of pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment of life. The pursuit of education, career goals, and financial stability can be overwhelming, leaving little room for leisure and relaxation. Additionally, the constant pressure to succeed and conform to societal expectations can create a sense of stress and dissatisfaction. In contrast, older individuals may have already achieved a level of stability and security that allows them to focus on personal interests and relationships. They have the time and resources to travel, pursue hobbies, and spend quality time with loved ones, all of which contribute to a sense of contentment. 

Furthermore, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. What brings joy to a young person may not hold the same appeal to an older individual. For example, a teenager might find excitement in attending concerts and parties, while a senior citizen might derive greater pleasure from spending time in nature or engaging in intellectual pursuits. The key to enjoying life lies in finding activities that align with one's values and interests, regardless of age. 

In conclusion, while youth may offer a certain vibrancy and sense of adventure, it is not a guarantee of happiness. Older individuals can experience profound joy and fulfillment through their accumulated wisdom, life experiences, and the freedom to pursue their passions. Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a personal journey that unfolds throughout the lifespan, and it is a mistake to assume that one age group has a monopoly on happiness.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions of products. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks, making products seem much better than they truly are. This is achieved through various techniques, including selective information, emotional appeals, and misleading visuals. 

Firstly, advertisements often present only the most positive aspects of a product, omitting any potential downsides. For example, a commercial for a weight loss product might showcase individuals achieving dramatic transformations, while conveniently neglecting to mention the rigorous exercise and dietary changes required. This selective presentation creates an unrealistic expectation that the product alone will deliver the desired results. 

Secondly, advertisements frequently employ emotional appeals to sway consumers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or even fear, they create a positive association with the product, regardless of its actual quality. A car commercial might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that owning the car will bring similar joy and fulfillment. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive purchases based on fleeting feelings rather than rational considerations. 

Finally, misleading visuals are often employed to enhance the attractiveness of a product. Retouched images, unrealistic lighting, and strategically placed props can create a false impression of quality and desirability. For instance, a food advertisement might use close-up shots of perfectly arranged ingredients to make the dish appear more appetizing than it actually is. This visual deception can lead consumers to purchase products that ultimately fail to meet their expectations. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often rely on exaggeration, emotional manipulation, and misleading visuals to create a distorted perception of products. By presenting only the most positive aspects, evoking emotions, and employing deceptive visuals, advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, potentially leading consumers to make uninformed decisions.",
"I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.Now adays advertising and media is every thing to consumers.Companys pay millions in ads. every year to survive in  the market and competition.
     It all goes back to the consumer,not every thing u see in the advertisements could exactly be the same as u see.or example the soup U see boilng in the TV looks always as if it tastes good,but U might try it once and it might not suit U.This why I say it all goes back to the consumer.Another example is a laptop which looks very nice in a newspaper advertisement,but once seeing it with ur eyes it looks smaller than the picture and not the right quality.There are lot of types of advertisements.One type is acompany whose looking for long term bussiness not willing to get out of the market easily ,so they try to keep there advertisement the closest to reality as much as possible.Another type is a company that wants to sell the product a couple of times and build the company on the support they will offer with the product,and these companies need to have nice advertising a little bit, than reality so the consumer can buy from the first pass.They companies are mainly found in the market and they are meduim run companies.Another type of company is a company who wants to sell its product for 1 time and leave with the profits,so this type of company has to pay alot in a very fansy way of advertising method so the consumer can buy once only .
    Finally what i can say  is people now a days are more and more educated than old days ,so most of the advertising should match up peoples thinking and they should be the closest to reality and the best looking to consumers.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray products, I firmly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This exaggeration is achieved through a variety of techniques, including selective information, unrealistic portrayals, and emotional appeals.
Firstly, advertisements often present only the most positive aspects of a product, while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks or limitations. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might highlight its sleek design and impressive camera capabilities, but fail to mention its short battery life or limited storage space. This selective information creates an idealized image of the product, leading consumers to form unrealistic expectations.
Secondly, advertisements frequently employ unrealistic portrayals to enhance the appeal of a product. Consider a commercial for a weight loss product that features a model with a perfect physique. This unrealistic depiction suggests that using the product will guarantee similar results, which is highly unlikely. Such unrealistic portrayals can mislead consumers into believing that the product is more effective than it actually is.
Finally, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers on a deeper level. For example, a commercial for a perfume might feature a romantic scene with a captivating soundtrack, evoking feelings of love and desire. This emotional connection can overshadow the product's actual qualities, leading consumers to purchase it based on sentiment rather than rational evaluation.
In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often exaggerate the benefits of products to create a more appealing image. Through selective information, unrealistic portrayals, and emotional appeals, advertisements can mislead consumers into believing that products are better than they truly are. It is essential for consumers to be aware of these tactics and to critically evaluate advertisements before making purchasing decisions.",
"Nowadays most products are advertised in order to be well selled. But do advertisements make products seem much better than they really are?
	First an advertisement is made to sell a product that could be brought back to the shop if it does not suit the customer, who might dispise the brand and not only the products if he is unhappy with it. Therefore it has to aim at the good buyers. It needs to describe the products in a positive way, of course, but in a honest way.
	But many people do not really care. And as some advertisements make a hole story about a useless tool, its competitors have to go further to make their product looks better. For example, we first got ""the wash powder that washed white"". Then a couple of years later as people got used to this statement, we got ""the wash powder that washes whiter than white"", whitch does not mean any thing at all. What is whiter than white? Coluche says, in one of his scketchs, that  he was afraid to use one of them because he was afraid it would make his clothes disapear! But as people buy products with such an exagerated advertisement, i think it encourages the brands to make them.
	Another thing that makes advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is that everything about the product that is not good, all its downsides, are only written in so tiny letters that nobody can read them. That partially hides the truth about the products and, of course, makes it more attractive. For example, when you see an advertisement about an internet connexion for 19 euros a month you are happy. But when you sign in and you notice it is 19 euros a month only for the first three months and then the price double, you are disapointed.
	That is why i totally agree with this statement : ""Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are""",
"Some people believe that having a broad knowledge in various academical subjects may lead them to greater depths in their carreer. On the other hand, there are also many examples of people concentrating on a single subject and specialize and make a carreer with it.
In my opinion, studying for a specified subject would be a more efficient and wiser decision to make. For example, when  you think yourself as a student who is having double major on two unrelated fields, you'll soon mix together what you have studied. The two essentials of the two fields would be congested. By the end of your study, you'll not be able to specialize in either of the subjects. You'll just be able know the basics of them which is not the best thing the succeed in life.
A further example of why choosing a single subject can be the attempting of a working carreer of your own in a certain field. For this to happen, you need to concentrate on a single subject at your academic career since you have to understand your subject with detail and from every point of view. This only occurs with specialization. Therefore' being ambitious in life, brings the need to specialize in a specified subject.
If we look at the problem from a student point of view, some students believe that broad knowledge on many subjects requires lots of time and a lot of sacrifice from social life. By this drawback, they easily select specializing in one subject. This could also be seen as a different reason of choosing a single subject to study.
As we have seen from the examples, it doesn't matter whether you are ambitious on specializing on a specified subject. The important thing is that, it is the wiser decision to take to reach what you are aiming in life. These aims can be listed as succeeding in working life, achieving on new discoveries of your subject, specializing on what you studied or even being able to spare time at your university years. For sake of your aims, it is better to have a knowledge on specifis subject.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may possess a certain carefree exuberance, claiming they inherently enjoy life more than their elders ignores the multifaceted nature of happiness and the unique challenges and rewards each stage of life presents. 

Firstly, youth often enjoys a sense of freedom and possibility that older people may not. They are less burdened by responsibilities, financial pressures, or the weight of past experiences. This allows them to explore new interests, take risks, and embrace spontaneity. For example, a young person might travel the world, pursue a passion project, or simply spend their days engaging in activities that bring them joy without the constraints of a demanding career or family obligations. However, this freedom comes at a cost. Young people may lack the stability and security that older people have built over time, leaving them vulnerable to uncertainty and instability. 

Conversely, older people have the advantage of accumulated wisdom, experience, and a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. They have weathered life's storms, learned from their mistakes, and developed a sense of perspective that allows them to appreciate the simple joys of life. For instance, an older person might find contentment in spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or simply enjoying the peace and quiet of their home. While they may not have the same physical energy or boundless optimism as their younger counterparts, they possess a depth of experience and a sense of fulfillment that can be equally, if not more, fulfilling. 

Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that varies greatly from person to person, regardless of age. While youth may have a certain advantage in terms of freedom and energy, older people possess a wealth of experience and wisdom that can contribute to a fulfilling and meaningful life. To claim that one age group enjoys life more than another is a reductionist view that fails to capture the richness and complexity of human experience.",
"Advertisements, which are important in selling products, make products seem better than they are in order to make it more appealing to consumers. Advertisers use many tricks and even false information to make the products seem better. Advertisements use aspects that appeal to people's senses, such as the way the product looks, smells, or feels.
	Most advertisements use vivid imagery to attract attention. Advertisers enhance the appearance of the product by different effects such as lighting or coloring. Commericials for food products sometimes do not use the real product, but a imitation that is made unrealisitically. For instance, when advertising a hamburger, advertisers might use a bigger or a more fresh looking imitation of the hamburger. When a person actually goes to buy the product, they will notice a significant difference in the real product in comparison to the product shown in the commericial.
	Also, many advertisements use claims that are usually false. The advertisement might imply that the product makes a person looks more beautiful or has the power to make someone smarter. A commercial for perfume might imply that the person using the product gains more attention from people. However, these claims are highly exaggerated to make the product popular among customers.
	Advertisers use people's weakness to appeal to them. For example, an advertisement commericializing a product that can lead to weight loss might show someone who is obese so that the consumer can relate to the advertisement and be convinced into buying the product. It is important for the consumer to question the product objectively.
	In conclusion, by different effects and methods, advertisements enhance the quality of the product, making it seem better than it actually is. This is to strengthen the purpose of the advertisements, which is to sell the product to many people.",
"In the realm of education, the age-old debate between breadth and depth of knowledge continues to spark lively discussions. While some argue that specializing in one specific subject is the key to success, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a more valuable asset. This essay will explore the reasons why a diverse intellectual foundation is essential for personal and professional growth.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By encountering different perspectives and methodologies across various disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles. This holistic approach enables them to identify patterns, draw connections, and formulate creative solutions to complex problems. For instance, a student with a broad understanding of history, economics, and psychology might be better equipped to analyze social issues and propose effective policy solutions.
Secondly, a wide range of knowledge enhances communication and collaboration. In today's interconnected world, individuals are increasingly required to work in interdisciplinary teams. A broad knowledge base allows individuals to understand and appreciate the perspectives of colleagues from different fields, fostering effective communication and collaboration. This ability to bridge disciplinary boundaries is crucial for tackling complex challenges that transcend traditional academic disciplines.
Finally, a broad education cultivates intellectual curiosity and lifelong learning. By exploring diverse subjects, individuals develop a thirst for knowledge and a desire to continuously expand their horizons. This intrinsic motivation fuels personal growth and allows individuals to adapt to the ever-changing demands of the modern world.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. It fosters critical thinking, enhances communication and collaboration, and cultivates intellectual curiosity. By embracing a diverse intellectual foundation, individuals can navigate the complexities of the modern world with greater confidence and adaptability.",
"Learning a wide knowlede of academic subjects is strongly important to nourish a person in univerisity. Although there are various methods of gaining educational programs through life, the university is necessary as the place for the pre-step to work in society. Let me explain these reasons as follows.

My primary reason is that a broad knowledge could stimulate students' interests or help students find their interests.  When I enrolled to Tokyo University , I was thinking about majoring in civil engineering. However, though many academic classes in first two years in the university, my interests expanded into a wider academic world. Although I majored in civil engineering, I could solve problems according to buiding structure or environment engineering with various aspects of thoughts such as economics or chemical science, owing to a boad knowledge.

Next, various skills will be required in workplace. Even one project of a constructing building need many knowledge and skills. To research the site to build precisely, scientific knowledge is important. Skill to make blue prints for it is also inevitable, in addition to the basic technique of using personal conputers. In order to exoplain this building plan to other people and share this concept, limitted knowlede and skills are impossible to work better with others.

If a students hope to concentrate on the specialized subject, he or she could enter the graduate program. In the graduate, students can pursue own interests more deeply and take a step to ahieve a career goal. However, the young has great potential which an individual never find it by themselves. Then, absorving the knowledge in the unknown world could play an important role through life.

I believe that unknown subjects of many academic subjects could expand students' interests and ability in university. Provided skills and knowlede in academic institutions also are required in the workplace someday. It is important the young to gain a wide variety exoerience though many subjects so as to solve many probelms and deepen own interests for good.",
"In fact, there are great changes of our life nowadays ,and the style of life is very fast than before .Most of the young people are busy about  their future in this type of life and have not enough time to help their communities because they care about themselves  only and sometimes because of the lack of their schedulest of young people are struggling to reach to high positions in their career and to increase their salaries.Concerning  their dreams to reach to high position in the job, the person exerts his best effort by any ways to achieve his goal to be for example , the manager of the company  ,so he seeks for himself not for his community .Second thing ,young peoples are caring about is to gain money as much as they can to be a rich man in ashort time , that can be through more than one job to save more money or by travelling abroad to gain more money , so the main aim of the young people is themselves only high position and much money ,and their communities are not in their minds.
	In addition to the previous reason , the young people have not enough time to serve their communities is the inability of the young people to arrange their times through a schedule or by  following the concept of  priority. Regarding  the schedule, If the person put aschedule everyday about the duties ,he will do , I think he can find enough time to help his community  through helping the poor people, give some training lessons to children. Second thing ,which is very important to the young people is to put in their minds the priority to give some time for his community by many ways to hel the community to solve its problems. The young peoples , besides their dreams , they should give sometime to their community.
	In summary , the young peoples have not enough time to help their communities due to their interesting only about their dreams to high rank and more money ,and otherthing, they  have not the ability to arrange the time and their societies ias away from their minds.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the question of whether to broaden one's horizons or delve deep into a specific field is a perennial debate. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial. This approach fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and prepares individuals for a rapidly evolving world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base cultivates intellectual curiosity. Exposure to diverse subjects sparks a thirst for understanding and encourages individuals to explore new ideas and perspectives. For instance, studying history alongside literature can provide a deeper understanding of the social and cultural contexts that shaped literary works. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the world.
Secondly, a broad education enhances critical thinking skills. By encountering different perspectives and methodologies across various disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information, identify biases, and formulate well-reasoned arguments. This critical thinking is essential for navigating complex issues and making informed decisions in a world saturated with information.
Finally, a broad knowledge base prepares individuals for a rapidly evolving world. In today's dynamic society, adaptability and the ability to learn new skills are paramount. A broad education provides a foundation for lifelong learning, allowing individuals to readily adapt to changing circumstances and embrace new opportunities. For example, a student with a broad background in science and technology may be better equipped to transition into a career in artificial intelligence or data science.
In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge of many academic subjects offers a more enriching and adaptable educational experience. It fosters intellectual curiosity, enhances critical thinking, and prepares individuals for the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world.

"I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than a very good knowledge on only one subject.
I think that if you got a broad knowledge, you will know what people mean when they talk aboute a topic you have heared aboute, even if you dont know much aboute it. You are not focused on your special subject tho whole time. You can free your mind, you are open for new things. Although the knowledge of only one subject, your special subject, offers good abilities for you, i prefer knowing less things aboute many subjects. Later you also got the chance to become a specialist in your subject, you can still sharp your skills, but at the biginning you should be ready and be prepared for things who can happen to you. Maybe you then go on with subjects, you didn't know some years before.

For example, if you have got no job and you are looking for one you have a big space to seach for it and you might can get a job which you didn't expected. If you are just a specialist in you subject, you might find faster a job, but only about you main knowledge. It will be very boring for you to do just the same thing your whole life.

I think so, because this is what happened to my father.
He first sharped his doctorial skills, because he wanted to become a doctor, but he also studied law. Now he is a laywer. This shows me that you have to be prepared for abilities you might get, but to do so you have to have a broad knowledge about many subjectcs, including academics. This is necessary to have a good and not boring job in the future.",
"The assertion that young people today are insufficiently engaged in community service is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to improving their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively involved in community service, demonstrating their commitment through various avenues. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental groups to animal shelters, youth are actively participating in initiatives that address pressing social issues. For instance, the rise of youth-led climate change activism, exemplified by Greta Thunberg's movement, showcases the passion and dedication of young people in tackling global challenges. These individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices to advocate for change, demonstrating a deep sense of responsibility towards their communities. 

Secondly, young people are utilizing their skills and talents to make a difference. Many young entrepreneurs are launching businesses with a social mission, aiming to create positive impact while generating income. For example, the growing popularity of ethical fashion brands founded by young designers highlights their commitment to sustainable practices and social responsibility. These individuals are not only contributing to the economy but also promoting ethical values within their communities. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to generalize about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From volunteering their time to utilizing their skills and talents, young people are actively engaged in making a positive impact. Their commitment to social responsibility and their innovative approaches to problem-solving demonstrate that they are not only shaping the future but also actively contributing to the well-being of their communities.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may be associated with carefree abandon and a sense of boundless possibility, it is a mistake to assume that older individuals are incapable of experiencing joy and fulfillment. In fact, life's journey, with its ups and downs, can lead to a deeper appreciation for the present moment and a more nuanced understanding of happiness. 

Firstly, young people often face significant pressures and anxieties that can hinder their enjoyment of life. The pursuit of education, career goals, and social acceptance can create a constant sense of urgency and stress. Older individuals, on the other hand, may have achieved a greater sense of stability and security, allowing them to focus on personal interests and relationships. For example, a retired teacher might find immense joy in volunteering at a local library, sharing their knowledge and passion with others. 

Secondly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves over time. What brings joy to a teenager might not hold the same appeal to a middle-aged adult. As we age, our priorities and values shift, leading to different sources of fulfillment. A young person might find excitement in attending a concert, while an older individual might derive greater satisfaction from a quiet evening spent with loved ones. 

In conclusion, while youth may offer certain advantages, it is inaccurate to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people. The experience of life, with its challenges and triumphs, can lead to a deeper understanding of happiness and fulfillment at any age. It is important to recognize that joy and contentment are not confined to any particular stage of life but rather emerge from the unique circumstances and perspectives of each individual.",
"I do agree on the statement that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities. 
I would saz the word nowadays could be taken out.
I can tell you from my personal expierience that this is not a new story. I was as well not a good kid in regards of helping our community. I always had the feeling that I do not have enough time to help.
When I came home from school, I did my homework and than I went to my sport classes. I just was part of the group and went home again. I also wanted to spend time for doing nothing and just relax a little bit. There was not enough time to do something else.
Now I know that this is not true, as a kid you have a lot of time to do something for your community. I did only realize this when I began to work and I saw that I will have not that much time in future.
I think the young people have the same problems as I had. They would like to spend their time for something more important for themselves. They do not realize that helping others would bring any benefits for them. Therefore it is not only the fault of the young people that they do not taking some time to spend with their community, it is as well a problem of communication
Due to the fact that only adults could communicate from their own experience, it is their responsibility to take action.
Parents and teacher should talk the ownership on this and get the young people up to speed. If the parents would explain how important the communities will be for the future of their kids. There will be more interaction with the community alrady. 
Teacher should raise this issue in their schools and maybe implement some community activities in their schedule. So that all kids could learn more about their communities and see by themselves that it is an important thing, so they will continue to participate in future activities. 
In conclusion, I would like to make the clear statement that everybody is responsible to help our communities and we should not pointing with the fingers to others.",
"Do you know this situation?Relaxing in front of the TV,watching a good movie and in the most exciting scene...Advertisement...!
Watching it you will recognize that all products are shown there, the best,the healthiest and the chaepest.But are they really that good, advertisment is promesing use?
If you ask me,they are not!
Take for example pills or cremes that promise you not get older and look like an fivteen- year- old- teen while you are an 50-year old grandmother.This is,short to say, a lie.Tests have shown that these cremes and all this stuff does not work and does not help you, to look younger and fresher, as it was promised.
One of the best examples is the new Coke Zero.Less sugar, even zero sugar but with the best taste you can imagen.So drinking Coca Cola will not longer be bad for your theeth and shape,the advertisment is telling us.But this is untrue.Replacing the original sugar through chemical reproductions,the new Coke affects in the same way our theeth and shape like the old one did.
In addition to that,in Germany there is at the moment a run on products indicating  to you and shown in serveral advertisments, that after consuming them, you are feeling better and fitter.So called Wellness-Products.In this case the problem is  the word Wellness is not saved and everyone is allowed to use it.So now many producers in Germany put the word Wellness on their products and sell it to the people.People buy them,hopping to feel better but nothing will happen.Wonder why, it is the same product as it was before only with an changed name which include Wellness.  

So I think almost every product shown in television seems much better than it really is.Consumers have to fight against this, because everyone has an right to know what is in the products and if the are helpfull or not.",
"In the pursuit of knowledge, the age-old debate between breadth and depth continues to spark lively discussions. While specialization in a specific subject offers profound expertise, I firmly believe that having broad knowledge across multiple academic disciplines is ultimately more beneficial. This perspective stems from the inherent interconnectedness of knowledge, the fostering of critical thinking, and the enhanced adaptability in a rapidly evolving world.
Firstly, a broad knowledge base allows individuals to see connections and draw insights across different fields. For instance, understanding the principles of economics can shed light on historical events, while a grasp of literature can enrich our understanding of social dynamics. This interdisciplinary approach fosters a holistic understanding of the world, enabling individuals to solve complex problems with a multifaceted perspective.
Furthermore, a broad education cultivates critical thinking skills. Exposure to diverse subjects challenges assumptions, encourages questioning, and promotes intellectual curiosity. By engaging with different viewpoints and methodologies, individuals develop the ability to analyze information objectively, evaluate arguments critically, and form well-informed opinions. This critical thinking prowess is invaluable in navigating the complexities of modern life.
Finally, in an era of rapid technological advancements and shifting societal landscapes, adaptability is paramount. A broad knowledge base equips individuals with the flexibility to navigate new challenges and embrace emerging opportunities. By possessing a diverse skillset and a comprehensive understanding of the world, individuals are better positioned to adapt to changing circumstances and thrive in a dynamic environment.
In conclusion, while specialization offers valuable expertise, a broad knowledge base provides a more holistic and adaptable foundation for success. By fostering interdisciplinary connections, cultivating critical thinking, and promoting adaptability, a broad education empowers individuals to navigate the complexities of the modern world with greater understanding and resilience.",

From organizing local clean-up drives to advocating for environmental sustainability, young people are taking the lead in addressing pressing issues. The recent surge in climate change activism, spearheaded by young individuals like Greta Thunberg, is a testament to their commitment to making a difference. 

Furthermore, many young people dedicate their time to volunteering at local organizations. Whether it's assisting at soup kitchens, mentoring underprivileged children, or supporting animal shelters, their contributions are invaluable. These acts of service not only benefit the community but also foster personal growth and a sense of purpose in young individuals.

"Some people say being a specialist in a specific field is most important thing in the ever-changing society. However, I strongly believe that having broad academic knowlege is much important than being a specialist.

First of all, learning wide knowledge of various subjects is helpful to  be well-rounded people and have a good relationship with others. When people learn the only one subject, they are well fitted in the field, but might not be a general people who mingle with any others. For example, Tae-hun Kim, who is my university friend, is on psychology major. He did not know about any other subject. Some day when I ask other friends to join a party in Kim's house, they answered reluctantly. I knew why they did. That was because Kim always talks only about psychologic issue. 

On top of that, it is beneficial not only to social relationship, but also to get good job in these day. Many company want to recruit versatil people who can be adjusted any department. Some department needs speicialists, but most of departments teach new people to work together. When people even want to make their own company, it will be more a helpful to be a this kind of versatil man. For instance, despite my brother's major is computer science, he tried to learn management and economics when he want to build his own computer software company. He already had good computer skills but he also needed management skill to manage his company, and economics' insight to read the current market flow. Now he is a one of the most famous CEO of a young venture company.

In brief, learning diverse knowledge have a positive effect on people's relationship and getting a good job. People should learn diverse kind of academic subject to be more well rounded people and have various knowledge to jet",

to be specialized in one specific subject is also a good thing it will make you a proffional in a specific subject, but when you it comes to socity they will choose a person with a broad knowldge than a person with a spacified knowledge, because they think that the one with more knowledge is more educated and when you talk to him he can understand whats the stituation or whats the question, talking to a person with broad knowldege gives you more chances and more apportunities to have more subjects to talk to that person with, but when you are specialliezed with only one subject it makes you stricted allthough you might be a profficional in that subject. 
A person can be educated and can be called intellgenet when he is familiar with all subjects, for example a lawyer will understand his custmers sitiouation more when he goes in details with the persons personality by using phsicology as trying to analyzie the persons problem and situation. 
a person with more knowldge is the person who used his life and his time by using every secound trying to learn more knowldge.
I as a person would like to talk to a person with a broad knowldge than talking to a person with a specific knowldge because i can gain more information from the person that have a broad knowledge. However, i also like to be a person with a broad knowldge so i can be able to talk with all people and not to freak out not knowing what to do when a person comes to talk to me asking me about a subject rather than telling him i have no idea, i would love to anser his question with a good answer. 
In conclution, from my point of view i totally agree to this statement because it makes sence to me also as the reasons that i mentioned above makes me belive more in this statmenet. Use your time wisely to be a better person.",
"I think an old saying of ""Jack of all and master of none"", in my opinion doesnot have much standing as times are changing fast and your considered fit in the circles you move when you can comprehend and also contribute.Therefore,I agree with the concept of being aware of a lot of disciplines than mastering either a few or only one of them.

 The requirements of this fast paced society,require you to be in touch with the latest developments in various fields.The reasons that I  would like to report relate to my field of work ,communication of agricultural innovations to the peasant community.Firstly,the situations under which the farmers  till their lands in the developing countries are full of challenges both natural and man-made.A knowledge of the latest technologies in remote sensing is an essential pre-requisite if I have to give weather based advisory on the kinds of crops to grow and the appropriate sowing times.This expertise could also be used in mapping those areas for the farmers which have great potential for growth.
 
        Another of an important learning area could be the crop survelliance techniques which could be utilised to fore-warn the farmers about the outbreak of  crop epidemics so that preventive measures are taken and farmers donot lose their hard raised crops and avoid huge annual losses to pest attack.

     Marketing intelligence, is one such field which has a direct relevence to what every one of us desire for, higher profits.If Iam aware of the national and international market trends,the same kinds of commodities may be recommended to the farmers to make avail of the growing markets.Consumer preferences and standards for organic foods are to be one of the knowledge areas.

   To summarise and conclude a varied knowledge is always better than a limited or restricred one.Therefore,keeping abreast of many fields is highly benificial in my opinion.",
"The pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong journey, and the question of whether it is better to have broad knowledge or specialize in one subject has been debated for centuries. While specialization offers in-depth expertise, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is ultimately more beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.


Firstly, a broad knowledge base fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When exposed to diverse perspectives and disciplines, individuals develop the ability to analyze information from multiple angles, identify patterns, and draw connections between seemingly disparate concepts. This holistic approach to learning equips individuals with the adaptability and flexibility necessary to navigate a rapidly changing world. For instance, a historian with a strong understanding of economics might be better equipped to understand the social and economic factors that shaped historical events. 

Secondly, broad knowledge promotes intellectual curiosity and lifelong learning. When individuals are exposed to a variety of subjects, they are more likely to develop an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore new ideas. This intrinsic motivation to learn extends beyond the confines of formal education, leading to a more fulfilling and enriching life.


Finally, a broad knowledge base fosters empathy and understanding across cultures. By engaging with different academic disciplines, individuals gain insights into diverse perspectives, values, and beliefs. This exposure to different ways of thinking and being promotes tolerance and appreciation for the richness and complexity of human experience.


In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, a broad knowledge base offers numerous advantages. It cultivates critical thinking, fosters intellectual curiosity, and promotes empathy and understanding. By embracing a diverse range of subjects, we equip ourselves with the tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world and contribute meaningfully to society.",
"I agree to the statement that the way of advertising a product often does not  show the reality, but there are several reasons for doing this. 
As an negative example the advertisment for cigaretts can be seen This often combines smoking with adventure and success or feeling free by showing the customer a non realistic way of living, like a cowboy. The result is that people often think, that this waz of lifing can onlz be reached in combination with an cigarett. This way of advertising is a negativ kind of mental influence. 
Actually smoking is a kind of toxic and it influences your feelings in a negative way by decreasing the flow of blood inside your body.

But there are also positive ways of influencing people and therefore different reasons of advertising a product in such a way. First of all the company has to sell itd product and therefore an effective way of advertising the product is absolutely necessary. It goes without saying , that products like alcohol or cigaretts cannot be sold by showing the reality of effects, that in some cases accour.
But if these products are not sold, companies will earn less money and people will loose their job.
Apart from these critcal products there are other necessary products.
Advertising these products refers to another another point which also deals with money. With the way of advertising a product ,the price which the customer has to pay can be influenced in an positive way. If the customer is convinced onces with qualitz of the product, he would at least pay a higher price for teh product. this of course leads to a better profit for the company itself. Moreover the higher profit can be used for  research and Development in order to produce higher qualitz products in the future. 
All in all I think it is an compet",
"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.  Why I agree with the statement is because, when I watch TV, I can see a lot of advertisement for good things, and when I see things from advertisements at store, it does no look quiet same as that of advertisement.  
	I like to watch TV, so I often watch a lot of advertisements on TV.  I have some experiences that I wanted to get things from that of advertisement.  When I was elementary school student, I saw an advertisement for a electoric staffed animal which can walk.  Then I really liked that staffed animal at a grance.  It looked so cute and can be walked very well.  Since I really wanted to get that staffed animal, I asked my mother to get it for me.  When I used the stuffed animal it did not walk like that of advertisement.  I was so sad.
	I think wy most adversisements make products seem much better than they really are iss because, they want to convince a lot of people to but their products.  Even though they can get more money thanks to thier advertisements, they are not saying true.  So I think it is not a good idia.  Also because of the advertisements that makes products seem much better than they really are, they can lose custommers' trusts.  It's very bad for them.  In addition to losing costomers's trusts, now I think a lot of people realized that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.  If so, these advertisenents can be lost thier purpose of their advertisement.
	I think it is very important for most advertisements who make products seem much better than they really are to realize costommers' mind, and make advertisements that can be trusted by a lot of costommers.",
"The assertion that young people today neglect community involvement is a sweeping generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which they contribute. While it's true that some young individuals may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others dedicate significant time and effort to bettering their communities. This essay will argue that young people are actively engaged in community service, often in innovative and impactful ways. 

Firstly, the rise of social media and online platforms has provided young people with powerful tools for mobilizing and organizing community initiatives. From online petitions to crowdfunding campaigns, they are leveraging technology to address issues ranging from environmental sustainability to social justice. For example, the recent surge in youth-led climate change protests demonstrates their commitment to tackling pressing global concerns. 

Secondly, young people are increasingly involved in traditional forms of community service. Volunteering at local soup kitchens, mentoring underprivileged children, and participating in neighborhood clean-up drives are just a few examples of their dedication. Many schools and universities also encourage and facilitate community engagement through service-learning programs, allowing students to gain valuable experience while contributing to their communities. 

Finally, it's important to recognize that community involvement takes many forms. Young people may not always be volunteering their time in the traditional sense, but they are contributing to their communities through their creativity, entrepreneurial spirit, and advocacy. For instance, young entrepreneurs are launching businesses that create jobs and support local economies, while artists and musicians are using their talents to inspire and uplift their communities. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to focus on the perceived apathy of some young people, it's crucial to acknowledge the widespread and diverse ways in which they are actively engaged in community service. From online activism to traditional volunteering, young people are demonstrating their commitment to making a positive impact on their communities, both locally and globally.",
"I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knoledge of many acadamic subject than spesialized one. One of the most imoprtent thing is time factor, so spending much time  on one subjects we will me good and master at the subject. For example, in the higher level education universities offering only in perticular subject rather than on prefer in more subjects. Broad knoledge will keep a person in the top in the position and every problem regading that will be solved by the person.speacialize acadamic subject will produce more bettre resulets ,when the person is more intrest in that subject.for examle, in the school some people get good marks in the perticuler subjects when compare to the other subjects, at this time we will encourage him in his intresting subjects rather than other. In later years he will be master at the subject and will takes researchs  in the field he will discover more intresting results in that area .

Let's take an example from the hestory of maths, great mathamatician Pythagars, in his school days he always preffer to solve maths problem to that of other subjects like social, science. After few years he became a great mathametician ,this is truly because of  his broad knoledge in that perticuler subject.From,this examle we can say that the perticuler subject should his intresting subjects.So ,from the several reasons and examples we can conclude that its better to have broad knoledge in one subject.",
"With the rapid developement of living stardard, great changes have taken place in choosing have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Currently, there is a wide spread feeling towords it is best to choose broad knowledge than to specialize subjects. Attitudes towards this hot issue are varied. some peaple place stress in the former that we should choose one specific subject while others havier weight to the latter that choose a lot of instesd. If asked to make a choice between the two, I would not hesitate to choose the latter over the former for some reasons.

First of all, to be frank, Because of the hardless for us to find jobs, it is best to choose broad knowledge to face the fierce choosing. This is play a vital part in the daily civalization. Therefore, we should learn about more and use this for our daily activities. This is also can brings about  a great many of practical skills if we have broad knowledge.

Secondly, it is a common saying that ""the more the best"". Of couse, it is considerable evidence to show that this give some skills for us to improve ourself in an efficient way. When you use this practical thing to deal with the thing, isn't it neccenry that they give some some consideration to why you can deal with it quickly. Certianly, it is your own broad  knowledge.

Soecific knowledge also has merits. You don not need to speed  a lot of time to study broad , because maybe there is no use for study some course to using in your daily activities, such as  some history.

In conclusion, all of the evidence justified an shakeble views that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic. It is not only for the valueble, but also for improve our own practical use. Why don't we have a try?",
"Though I agrees with the notion that specializing on a specific subject have more potential for contribution to knowledge as a whole, but I also thinks that confining to a specific line of discipline may leads to missing of understanding of how everything fits together.There are other points which leads to my standpoint.

We live in an information age in which we have access to a sea of data. Furthermore, each subject area in itself has lots of academic literature about the knowlege accumulated throughout the ages in it. Only ff a person  confine to a specialzed field and narrow down the point of focus, innovative research is possible. It may appear that in an attempt to gain wider knowledge, the student can just study what is available without getting any chance to contribute to it. Though this is true, we should not miss the point that by understanding the context and knowing  how things work together can only takes one to a position that can lead him to actually contribute to the field. Historically, many of our researcher have contributed to a large variety of scientific discipline and proving the fact that knowing all peices together gives a unique perspective and hence innovation. Like thomas edison, leonardo da Vinci, Nicholas Tesla are all prolific researcher contributing to all scientific discipline.

I also believe that some scientific discipline like Medicine, only being specialist can provide proper skill to perform well.  We trust only specialist when it comes to medical treatment. Why we go to eye specialist when we have an eye problem rather than a general physician. The reason being that our body part are so complex that it requires a focussed pursuit of specialized knowledge to understand it. But this does not strongly supports specialist because it is the general physician who also hold vital position in giving initial treatment and direct or recommend physician only in case it crosses it's limit. Here we see again that general physician's varied knowledge allow him to better understand and diagonise the problem initially.

So in the society we live in today both speacialist; who pusue specialisation in subject, and Generalist; who have broader knowledge of subject, are important. Giving importance to any one will  be unjustified; if not problematic.",
"I disagree with this statement. First of all I think that the lack of help within the communities is a problem in general. It does not only concern young people, but everybodey. I think it is more a problem of peoples' state of mind than of young people beeing selfish. The overall attitude of people towards helping each other and puting themself up for something good has gone worse. Most people are completely focused on themselves. They only care about their work, interests or their own problems. But in my opinion there have been many attemps to improve this situation. Many companys for example expect from the candidates who apply for a job that there has been some kind of engagement, which is not supposed to relate to their education directly. That is why many students join organisations in their community, which purposes are to take care of other students or engage for social matters. This way they learn to take over responsibility and keep this state of mind up in their future life, teaching this to their kids later on. There are also some companys who support their communities themselves by making donations or supporting students, hospitals, kindergardens etc. in their communities in some other  way. The value of the community and taking over responsibility has increased I think. The issue has become more present in the meantime. Hectic and pressure are controlling many peoples' lifes. For young people it is especially their fear of the future. But eversince this way of living has occured, people more and more feel the need of comfort and support. The urge of having someone helping and supporting them, will hopefully result in a chance of mind. That is why I am thinking that there will be improvements concerning this issue. Not only in young peoples'  but everybody's mind.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the complexities of human experience. While youth may be characterized by a certain carefree exuberance and a sense of boundless possibility, it is not necessarily indicative of greater enjoyment. In fact, older individuals often possess a deeper appreciation for life's nuances and a more profound understanding of happiness. 

Firstly, young people are often burdened by the pressures of education, career choices, and financial instability. The constant pursuit of success and the fear of failure can create a significant amount of stress and anxiety, hindering their ability to truly enjoy the present moment. Conversely, older individuals have typically achieved a degree of stability and financial security, allowing them to focus on personal fulfillment and leisure activities. They have the time and resources to travel, pursue hobbies, and spend quality time with loved ones, all of which contribute to a sense of contentment. 

Furthermore, older people have accumulated a wealth of life experiences that shape their perspective and enhance their appreciation for the simple joys. They have witnessed both triumphs and setbacks, learned from their mistakes, and developed a deeper understanding of human nature. This wisdom allows them to navigate life's challenges with greater resilience and to find happiness in the everyday moments that younger people may overlook. 

In conclusion, while youth may be associated with a certain level of carefree enjoyment, it is not necessarily indicative of a greater capacity for happiness. Older individuals, with their accumulated wisdom, stability, and appreciation for life's simple pleasures, often experience a more profound and enduring sense of contentment. The enjoyment of life is not solely determined by age but rather by one's ability to find meaning and fulfillment in their experiences, regardless of their stage in life.",
"There are two different aspects which makes the question difficult to answer if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specitic subject. 
At first if you study undergraduate it is neccesary to get a lot of information from diffrent academic subjects. Because you do not know anything about that subject you study and so you have to lern a lot. You have to learn practical things like how to prepare an essay or how do i have to work out my letters for the proffesors or maybe how can i regestrade me in the system at the university. Also you have to learn a lot of stuff to get the ability to talk with someone around your topic.It is necessary to know the topic.I will give an example if you are studying architecture you have to know how to build a house if you do not know this it makes no sence to learn other things like interior design.So  If you do not kmow basics you can not go on futher. Therfore i found it very importent to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.
Second if you are a graduate student who know the pasics he can consentrade on speciffic subjects. Maybe for interrior design or special concrets. In the upper classes i would say  you have to specifies your topic.
However at the end i have to say that it gives no genuraly answer on this question. It depense on you life situation.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a simplistic generalization that fails to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of happiness and the diverse experiences that shape our perception of life. While youth may be characterized by a certain exuberance and freedom from responsibilities, equating this to greater enjoyment is a mischaracterization of the human experience. 

Firstly, the concept of enjoyment is subjective and evolves throughout life. Young people may find joy in the novelty of experiences and the pursuit of new adventures. However, older individuals often derive satisfaction from the depth of their relationships, the fulfillment of their goals, and the wisdom gained through years of living. For instance, a seasoned artist might find more profound joy in the culmination of their life's work than a young musician just starting out.
Secondly, the challenges and responsibilities faced by older individuals can foster a sense of accomplishment and purpose that young people may not yet have experienced. Overcoming obstacles and navigating life's complexities can lead to a deeper appreciation for the simple joys and a stronger sense of self-worth. Conversely, the pressures of youth, such as academic expectations and social anxieties, can sometimes overshadow the enjoyment of the present moment.
In conclusion, to assert that young people enjoy life more than older people is to overlook the richness and complexity of the human experience. While youth may offer a certain carefree spirit, the joys and satisfactions of life are not limited to any particular age group. Happiness is a journey, and each stage of life presents its own unique opportunities for fulfillment and enjoyment.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception, often fueled by romanticized views of youth. While youth offers certain advantages, such as boundless energy and a sense of limitless possibilities, claiming it guarantees a more fulfilling life is a simplification.
Both young and old individuals experience joy, sorrow, and everything in between, and the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that varies greatly depending on individual circumstances and perspectives.
One argument against the statement is that older individuals often have a greater appreciation for life's simple pleasures. Having experienced the ups and downs of life, they may value moments of peace, quiet, and connection with loved ones more than the constant pursuit of excitement that often characterizes youth. For example, a retired grandmother might find immense joy in tending her garden and spending time with her grandchildren, while a young professional might be consumed by the demands of their career.
Furthermore, older individuals often possess a greater sense of wisdom and perspective, allowing them to navigate life's challenges with more resilience and grace. They have learned from their past mistakes and are better equipped to handle adversity. This accumulated wisdom can lead to a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them, fostering a sense of contentment and fulfillment.
In conclusion, while youth offers certain advantages, it is not a guarantee of a more enjoyable life. Both young and old individuals experience life in their own unique ways, and the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that depends on individual circumstances, perspectives, and values. To claim that one age group enjoys life more than another is a gross oversimplification that ignores the complexities of human experience.",
"I disagree with the steatement because, in my opinion, it is better have a lot of knowledge about one specific subject, that to know only a little of many academic topics.
On the one hand, even though a lot of persons can think that having information about a variety of subjects could make a professor or a student to have a better backwround in his or her professional formation, on the other hand, I consider it is negative not to have a deep knowledge of one main area. Is always better to understand perfectly one thing than to have a small idea of many things.
Thereby, to have a large knowledge in one single academic subject have practical applications because, it will be easier for that person to trasmit well consolidated information to others.
Moreover, some specifics points of the academic life, according to my opinion, can only be achieved with a huge knowledge of one topic. For instance, to make a research in one area, it will be necesary to count with a lot of information in that subject. However, to have an idea of several topics will be useless to develope deepely enough the investigation accuratelly.
Furthermore, to understand perfectly one single subgect could have potentially a large economic benefit, for in some circunstances, diferent companies and industries needs persons with specific knowledge about one area to solve a punctual problem. 
In conclusion, I believe that to focus oneself in studing deeply a single subject instead of studing a large number of academic areas will bring always more possitive results.",
"The present statement is a false dichotomy on an essential academic topic: is breadth of knowledge better than specialized knowledge ? I will develop the reasons why I consider that building broad and specialize knowledge are both essential and complement each other.

To have a wide knowledge of many academic subjects is essential nowadays and will be even more important in the future. The world we live in moves fast and new technologies have enabled an exponential growth of network connections between people from different background and cultures. Therefore having a broad understanding of different cultures and industries is key for an individual to understand and evoluate in our world.

Conversely, specific and specialize knowledge is essential in order to contribute to the development of our civilization. To master all the aspects and challenges of the discipline is essential in order to contribute to its development. Having insight on a specific topic is a strength which could infer numerous jobs opportunities. 

One of my science teacher at university used to say that the more specialize a discipline is, the more broad knowledge you need to understand the mechanisms of nature and physics. He used to think that somehow many scientific disciplines converges towards a unique truth (an old scientist dream).

As a conlusion, I believe there are no reasons for contending that broad knowledge is more essential than specialize knowledge (or vice-versa). As a matter of fact, I consider they complement each other. I would even add that what is essential in our today world is to learn how to learn in order to be able to adapt ourselves to our ever fast muting civilization.",
"The world of advertising is a captivating realm where products are presented in their most alluring light. While some advertisements may accurately portray the benefits of a product, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image, often exaggerating or even fabricating qualities to entice consumers. This tendency to present products as superior to reality is a pervasive practice in the advertising industry, and it is a strategy that often proves successful in driving sales. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a weight-loss product might showcase individuals with dramatic transformations, but fail to mention the rigorous exercise and dietary changes required to achieve such results. This selective presentation creates a misleading impression of the product's effectiveness. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to sway consumers. They evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or even fear to associate these emotions with the product. A car commercial might depict a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that purchasing the car will bring similar joy and freedom. This emotional manipulation can lead consumers to make impulsive decisions based on feelings rather than rational assessment. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may accurately reflect the qualities of a product, it is undeniable that many strive to create an idealized image that is often far removed from reality. The use of selective information, emotional appeals, and other persuasive techniques can mislead consumers into believing that a product is better than it truly is. This practice, while effective in driving sales, raises ethical concerns about the transparency and honesty of advertising.",
"As students start off in College, during your undergraduate  years they experience the broad spectrum of knowledge, they  take courses from different departments, such  as:  english, spanish, mathematics, social sciences, arts, etc. The main goal is to prepare an intergral individual and at the same time expose students to new disciplines.  After College, hopefully  you move into graduate studies and your knowledge is directed towards a specific area, its like a diamond shape effect, you learn a little bit of everything as a college student and then you learn a lot about a certain area during graduate school.



I believe a combination of both is perfect, its good to know a little about everthing and at the same time a lot about a certain area, but since I have to pick sides I would say that its better to specialize in one specific subject.  Broad knowledge gives you flexibility, but specialized knowledge designs  experts in a certain area. For example, interdisciplinary research encompasses both broad and specific.  Scientists with different expertise get together to solve a problem. Specific knowledge creates new mind sets in the students and prodessionals.  Specially when a group of scientists gather to solve a problem. Chemists, Physics mayors and Math",
"In day to day life we see that  people are growing very fast and passing their lives with good and bad things but i agree the statement that young people will enjoy their lives more than old people do.
                            young people are having lot of energy in them so that they can enjoy a lot more than old people.In medical terms we can say that young people are fresh because they are having good nerves and blood and their body functions will work with full enthusiasm than old people.If people grew older and older their body functions cannot work properly.
                             In my life i saw few situations regarding this.I will describe some situations over here.For example,in my street many people play badminton during evenings that is both young and old people.While playing young people will play for lot of time than old people do.Old people will easily get tried while playing because they are not having that much energy to play.This shows that how young people enjoy life more than old people do.
                              From the statement we can also consider that enjoyment means what kind of enjoyment?It depends on situation .But i can say that whatever the enjoyment is that young people will enjoy a lot than old people do.Here we can can say one thing that old people are one time young people only so they know everything in their lives because they already passed over that stages and they will also feel that early age in their lives are golden days .
                              From the statement my conclusion is old people are one time young people only so they know that they are having lot of energy during their early stages and they can also say that they enjoyed a lot while they were young.So i can say that young people will enjoy a lot than old people do.",
"Some people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. According to me this statement is true but not all young people do not give a help to the their communities. I live in an university college.  My friends and me are very busy with exams, classes and laboratories. For example we are in the university from 8.00 am to 6.00 pm all the days! So we return to the college very, very tired! However, when we go back to the college we find time to help our community. For examples some student work in the college's garden, others help our secretary in the office, others help in the kitchen and so on. I think that if you believe in something you will find time to do it. I know, other student in my college do not help the community because they are out for all the day and go back to the college only for the dinner.  They tell us that they have not time because they study all the day. But this is not a good reason, according to me. I have to study too! I want to pass all the exams and degree soon but I am in a college with other people and so I want to help my community because I think it is a right thing. Today young people are busy in not important activities and so they have not time for important things, such as helping the community. In the feature I hope my sons understand this because helping community is one of the best thing we can do in our lives.",
"Do young people nowadays don't spent enough time in helping their communities? I strongly agree with the speaker in few points. 
     First of all, the youth nowadays simply do not have to help their communities because of they lack the interest of their communities. Because of the arise of the individualism they now focus on their own self-interest and happiness. We now see alot of young people just enjoying their lifes or prparing for their future carreers. They don't have time to look after their communities or those who are sick and poor. Many of them just simply enjoy going to parties and get drunk and give their time in making girl-or-boy friends.
     Second, the young nowadays don't have time to help and participate in helping their communities  even though they are interested in helping others. They are unfortuantley caught up in their school's study or assignment in order to survive in our over competivive society. They get up early in the morning for school and they might attend after school activity or academic insitutions that will help their courses. Many young student work in a part-time job to finance their tuition and board. 
     Lastly, even though some students do spend some time in helping their communities, it is not a long term participation but becoming more of an one time event without enthusiasim or passion. Because of the economic growth and increased the notion of quaility of life, they don't feel the real need to help others who are disadvataged. They were hardly never in a situation when they hungry without food and with no place to sleep. This might be a reason for them to actually not to have some sympathy towards helping others which might make them less active.
     In sum, because of the reasons stated above I strongly think that the youth nowadays lack time, interest and effort in a long-term activity in helping their communuities.",
"In the realm of consumerism, advertising plays a pivotal role in shaping our perceptions of products and services. While some argue that advertisements accurately portray the benefits of goods, I firmly believe that most advertisements exaggerate the qualities of products, making them appear far superior to their actual capabilities. This essay will explore the reasons behind this phenomenon, drawing upon specific examples to illustrate my point. 

One of the primary reasons why advertisements often present an idealized version of reality is the pursuit of profit. Advertisers are driven by the desire to sell their products, and they employ various techniques to entice consumers. This often involves highlighting the most appealing aspects of a product while downplaying or completely omitting its drawbacks. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might showcase its sleek design and advanced camera features, but it might fail to mention its limited battery life or its susceptibility to overheating. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals to connect with consumers. By evoking feelings of happiness, excitement, or desire, advertisers can create a positive association with their products, even if those feelings are not genuinely warranted. Consider a commercial for a luxury car that features a family enjoying a scenic road trip. While the car itself may be impressive, the advertisement primarily focuses on the emotional experience of driving it, rather than its practical features. 

In conclusion, it is evident that most advertisements tend to present an overly optimistic view of products, often exaggerating their benefits and downplaying their limitations. This is driven by the pursuit of profit and the use of emotional appeals to connect with consumers. While advertising can be informative, it is crucial to approach it with a critical eye, recognizing that it is often designed to persuade rather than to provide an objective assessment of a product's true value.",
"Some people think yonger people enjoy life more than older people do, because they are healthier than older people. I, however, think older people can enjoy life more than yonger people because of my personal experience. I, therefore, disagree with the statement which says yonger people enjoy life more than older people do.
       Older people have more knowledge than yonger people. They have lived longer lives than yonger people and they have had more knowledge than them. Therefore, older people will try new things that are good for them. For example, young people spend their time to play or play games with their friends on weekend, however, older people climb the mountain with their business members or travel somewhere to rest. This shows that older people do better activities than yonger people, which what make them to be healthier.
Therefore, I belive that older people enjoy life more than yonger people.
       Older people have more money than yonger people. This means older people have more alternatives to do. For example, one day my father told a story about ski-diving. At that time I did not know about ski-diving so my father brang me a place where is for ski-diving. Many people were enjoying it and I really wanted to try. I, however, did not have money at that time, therefore, I could not do that and I thought older people are lucky because they have money to do ski-diving.
       Older people can enjoy life more than yonger people because they have more knowledge about life and money, which means they have more alternatives. My personal experience taught me that older people can play more sports than yonger people and older people know more about what is good for them, I, therefore, disagree that yonger people enjoy life more than older people do.",
"Today, we usually heard that young people are not interesting in helping their communities. I think that young people have a different vision of that. They help their communities, but in a different way than ten years ago. 

First, the structure of a family has changed. There are more divorces, parents and children can live kilometers far away from each other etc. I think this could explain why young people feel less concerned about old people for example. But we can see some experiences in France to reduce the gap between old persons and children. Some schools have organised meeting, every week, where each child has a grandfather or a grandmother for the meeting. They play and make activities together. It is an interesting experience for children because lots of them have lost their grand parents or live far away from them. Moreover, they learn to care for old people.

In addition,  youg people have different behaviours because they have different educations. If the parents teach their children to help other people, I think they would follow this lesson later.  If they see parents helping a neighbour or someome of the family for example.

Another point is that the current society and parents ask a lot from young people. There is a lot of competition between parents because they want to show that their children are ""better"" than others in school, sport, music, etc.  This mean that children have lots of activites during the week and the week end so they have less time to spend for their communities.

Finally, I think that young people help their communities but they could give more time for it. Parents have to teach children that family and community are important and that they have to take care of each other.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which young people contribute. While it's true that some may prioritize personal pursuits, countless others actively engage in community service, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility. 

Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-ups to supporting local charities, they dedicate their time and energy to causes they believe in. For instance, the rise of youth-led initiatives like the 'Fridays for Future' movement showcases young people's commitment to addressing global issues like climate change. These individuals are not only volunteering their time but also using their voices to advocate for change. 

Secondly, the digital age has empowered young people to contribute to their communities in innovative ways. Through online platforms, they can raise awareness for social causes, organize fundraising campaigns, and connect with like-minded individuals to create positive change. For example, social media campaigns have been instrumental in mobilizing young people to support disaster relief efforts and advocate for human rights. 

In conclusion, while it's easy to make sweeping statements about young people, it's important to recognize the diverse ways in which they contribute to their communities. From traditional volunteer work to online activism, young people are actively engaged in making a difference. Their commitment to social responsibility and their innovative approaches to problem-solving demonstrate that they are not only shaping the future but also actively contributing to the well-being of their communities.",
"The statement that young people today do not dedicate enough time to community service is a generalization that fails to acknowledge the diverse ways in which youth contribute. While it's true that some young people may prioritize personal pursuits, many actively engage in their communities, demonstrating a strong sense of civic responsibility.


Firstly, young people are increasingly involved in volunteer organizations. From environmental clean-ups to tutoring programs, youth are dedicating their time and skills to address local issues. For example, the recent surge in youth-led climate change activism showcases their commitment to creating a better future for their communities. These initiatives highlight their willingness to go beyond personal interests and contribute to the collective good. 

Secondly, the rise of social media has provided a platform for young people to advocate for social causes and raise awareness about important issues. Through online campaigns and petitions, they mobilize their peers and influence public opinion, fostering positive change within their communities. For instance, the #BlackLivesMatter movement, initiated by young people, sparked global conversations about racial injustice and led to significant policy changes. 

In conclusion, while some young people may not actively participate in traditional forms of community service, it's unfair to claim that they are not contributing. Their involvement in volunteer work, online activism, and social entrepreneurship demonstrates their commitment to making a difference in their communities. The diverse ways in which young people engage in civic responsibility should be acknowledged and celebrated.",
"I think how much he/she enjoy life does not depend on how old he/she is. So I disagreeto the statement, because it shows me that the difference of  age cause some difference on enjoying life.

The main reason of my opinion is whenever people can feel joyful on any situations only by his/her own feeling. And how peolple enjoy life does deeply depend on how people think of happiness. It will change even in the same person in the different ages.

The case of sports, for example football, to run or move quickly, we need the good phisical abilities and sensors. The younger people is, the quicker he/she moves. But the quickness or speeds are not only consisted of the joyful of football. To think the stragegy of goal or defence is one of the main portion of making the game. So the expariences of elder people will contribute to feel joyful on football game. So both young and old people have a chance to enjoy football.

Another case, in the season of roses, a person who knows many roses' names feels happy to get the new one only shown in the books, another person who have a good sensitive nose to feel the difference of the roses enjoy the smell of them. In this case, these two persons skill or talent does not matter with ages.

As I mentiond in above two examples, the sensitiveness or musule abilities might depend on how old he/she is. It is one of the difference between young and elder people, mainly coused by matuare and phsical conditions.So there is a possibility for younger people enjoy much more.But we human has a good matuared brain and how happy we are is jugged by his/her own brain. So if  the person feel his life is happy, that is the evicence of spending his/her life with happyness and enjoying. Anyone without him/herself can jugge how enjoy life anothers person.",
"The notion that young people enjoy life more than older people is a common misconception. While youth often possesses a certain carefree energy and a sense of limitless possibilities, equating this with greater enjoyment is a simplification. Both young and old experience life's joys and sorrows, and the perception of enjoyment is subjective and evolves with age. 

Firstly, young people often prioritize immediate gratification and excitement, which can lead to a feeling of intense pleasure in the moment. They may find joy in exploring new experiences, socializing with friends, and pursuing their passions. However, this focus on the present can also lead to a lack of perspective and an inability to appreciate the nuances of life. Older people, on the other hand, have had more time to reflect and develop a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them. They may find satisfaction in simpler things, like spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, and contributing to their communities. 

Moreover, the concept of enjoyment is not solely based on external factors. It is also influenced by internal factors such as emotional maturity, resilience, and a sense of purpose. While young people may experience a wider range of emotions, they may also be more susceptible to negative experiences and setbacks. Older people, having weathered life's storms, often possess a greater capacity for resilience and a more balanced perspective on life's challenges. This can lead to a deeper sense of contentment and fulfillment, even in the face of adversity. 

In conclusion, while young people may experience a certain type of enjoyment associated with youthful exuberance, it is not necessarily indicative of a greater overall enjoyment of life. Older people, with their accumulated wisdom, emotional maturity, and sense of purpose, often find fulfillment and contentment in different ways. Ultimately, the enjoyment of life is a subjective experience that evolves throughout one's lifespan, and it is impossible to definitively say that one age group enjoys life more than another.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some advertisements may accurately portray products, I strongly agree that most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and qualities of products, making them seem far better than they truly are. This tendency is driven by the inherent goal of advertising: to persuade consumers to buy. 

One common tactic employed by advertisers is the use of selective information and misleading claims. For instance, a commercial for a weight loss product might showcase individuals who have achieved dramatic results, while conveniently omitting the fact that these results are often temporary or achieved through rigorous exercise and dietary changes. Similarly, advertisements for beauty products often use heavily edited images and filters to create an unrealistic standard of beauty, leading consumers to believe that the product can deliver miraculous transformations. 

Furthermore, advertisements frequently rely on emotional appeals and psychological manipulation to create a sense of urgency or desirability. They may use catchy jingles, celebrity endorsements, or heartwarming stories to evoke positive emotions and associate them with the product. This emotional connection can overshadow rational decision-making, leading consumers to purchase products based on feelings rather than facts. 

In conclusion, while some advertisements may be informative and truthful, the majority strive to present products in the most appealing light possible, often resorting to exaggeration and manipulation. By understanding the tactics employed by advertisers, consumers can become more discerning and avoid falling prey to misleading claims. It is crucial to critically evaluate advertisements and rely on independent sources of information before making purchasing decisions.",
"Advertisements occupy a big part in our lives as the every communication tool that we use; such as televisions, internet and newspapers gives advertisements  of many products. Even if we do not want to admit that advertisements cannot direct our shopping preferences, most of us are affected from the advertisements we see. 
	First of all, the advertisements affect our shopping preferences in a way that we prefer to buy a product that we have heard before. Most of us do not want to pay to a product  that we have never heard of because we do not want to take a risk. Advertisements make a product known by the community and knowing a product causes us to trust that product. As a result, we prefer to buy a product that we trust. 
	Secondly, we think unintentionally that the products investing high amounts of money to advertisement are really qualified than the products that do not make any advertisement. For instance, The Coca Cola Company really spends a huge amount of money to make advertisements all over the world and its products really make good profits throughout the whole world because we all assume that cola produced by the Coca Cola Company is better that any other cola that is producerd in our hometown. 
	Lastly, advertisements can present an innovative product. We may not realize that we need such a product until we see its advertisement. For example, cell phones are used by many people all around the world and every day we learn a new feature that is added to cell phones by means of advertisement. We realize that a cell phone that can play songs is necessary for us only after we see its advertisement. In fact, we do not need a cell phone that can play songs, but advertisements cause us to think so. 
	In conclusion, advertisements make a product seem better in a variety of ways and cause us to buy that product.",
"Young people are the fundamental building blocks of any community. They are its foundation, whether it be culturally, politically or even socially. I believe that young people contribute precious time to helping their communities as they are well sensitised to the problems that it faces.

The youth of any country is an essential ingredient in the larger matrix of a well-knit community. Young people, through various media and other fora, like television, the internet, are exposed to the grond realities in their community. Education also informs them about the problems plaguing their community, and modes and methods of resolving these problems. For example, by the constructive use of demonstrations and  petitions, students in India have been at the vanguard of a silent yet sturdy movement seeking to transform the current status quo of lethargy and sloth in politics into one of efficiency and nimbleness. 

With the advent of the internet, the young people have found an articulate mouthpiece. They are frequently expressing their opinions through blogs and what have you may. Owing to their adaptive and dynamic nature, the youth has its finger firmly on the community's pulse. With the rapid pace with which the different forms of communication emerge, the youth are sure to become major shareholders in the future from being mere stakeholders as of now.

However, such fervour on part of the youth should be guided by experienced and responsible members of the community. At times, unregulated action by the youth has led to catastrophies. For example, during the Cutlural Revolution in China, the Red Guards, as the youth was referred to, at the behest of Chairman Mao Zedong, without any inkling as to how to improve their society, lead to the killing and slaughter of intellectuals, the very intellectuals who were agents of change in the community. 


In conclusion, the youth has done its fair share of community service. In fact, they have been welcome agents of change amidst a sea of senility and inaction by previous generations. The role essayed by them will only increase in size and stature as time progresses.",
"In my opinion, and experience, old people can enjoy life as much as the younger. I belive that people can be of an old age , but still be 'young of hearth' as far as i have seen is mostly related to how the person lives his life and how he thinks on himself.

   Many people belives that to enjoy life one has to be young, the truth is that many of the people that thinks that way will not enjoy life when they get older because of the way they think. As exanple of this i could relate about my grandmother: from what my mother has told me of her i know she always feared to be old and tried always to hide her age and she did all this because in ther mind she was getting too old to and was afraid of being useless. I have met other people like her, and aging is not good with them. In the other hand i have my grandfather: he never cared much for his age and always said he was as the wine: 'getting  better with each year' and is truth ,is a sense, since even tought he is 5 years older than my grandmother he is in much more active and seems younger than her. Constantly we have examples of this kind of person,  people that does amazing things even at their advanced age amazing all of us ,younger people, that cant do those things.

   I Think that also the character of a person is very important, some people are jovial and carefree and if they keep those traits as they get older they will be able to enjoy life as much as they did when they were younger. For example some people say: 'im 55 years old. Im too old for those things' others will say 'im only 55 years old. Why can't i do that?' and if they dont see  any obstacle in their age then it will not be any obstacle for them and they will enjoy life at its fullest not mattering the age they reach.",
"I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
In our life the advertisements are almost everywhere, you can see them on newspaper, tv,wall,car and subway. When you see the products on them, The products look so nice. Everyone want to buy them, but when you got them, they did not seem better than advertisements. 

The frist reason that I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For example some advertisements on TV, they look so nice, so people will to buy these products, when they got the products, but it is not so good. Thus some people will make more money.

The second reason that I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, most advertisements are made by a lot people. They know how to make products better than they are really. So people like to buy them.

The third resaon that I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, some products do not really good, if they do not make the advertusements better they will sale a few. So people spend more money on the advertusements so they can sale more products, they will make more money than before.

Successfully when we know that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. we can buy some products that we really need. Do not buy those products seem better on the advertisements.

So I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.",
"It is undeniable that advertisements play a significant role in shaping consumer perceptions and influencing purchasing decisions. While some argue that advertisements accurately reflect the qualities of products, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, most advertisements tend to exaggerate the benefits and downplay the drawbacks of products, creating an idealized image that often falls short of reality. 

One of the most common tactics employed by advertisers is the use of selective information. They highlight the positive aspects of a product while conveniently omitting any potential downsides. For instance, a commercial for a new smartphone might showcase its sleek design and impressive camera capabilities, but fail to mention its limited battery life or its susceptibility to overheating. By focusing on the positives, advertisers create an illusion of perfection that can mislead consumers. 

Furthermore, advertisements often rely on emotional appeals to sway viewers. They use catchy jingles, heartwarming stories, or aspirational imagery to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or belonging. These emotions can cloud consumers' judgment, making them more likely to purchase a product based on its emotional appeal rather than its actual utility. For example, a commercial for a luxury car might feature a family enjoying a scenic road trip, implying that owning the car will bring them happiness and fulfillment. However, the reality is that the car itself does not guarantee happiness, and consumers may be disappointed when their expectations are not met. 

In conclusion, while advertisements can be informative, they often present a distorted view of reality. By selectively highlighting positive aspects, employing emotional appeals, and creating unrealistic expectations, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Consumers should be aware of these tactics and exercise caution when making purchasing decisions based solely on advertising.",
